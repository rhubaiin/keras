EGFR \\nis involved in multiple signaling pathways and regulates \\nnumerous cell functions (Fig.\\xa0 1A). This transmembrane \\nglycoprotein is composed of a cysteine-rich extracellu -\\nlar ligand binding domain, hydrophobic transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic RTK domain, and C-terminal \\ndomain. The RTK domain contains an N-lobe consist -\\ning of five β-sheet strands and one αC helix and a C-lobe \\ncontaining the main helices of a highly flexible activa -\\ntion loop (A-loop) [1]. The deep cleft at the junction of \\nthese two lobes forms the binding pocket for the adenine \\nring of ATP . The conformation of three conserved struc -\\ntural elements, namely the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, \\nαC helix, and A-loop, critically regulates the activation \\nor inactivation of the catalytic domain. When EGFR is \\nin the active state, the important catalytic residue D855 \\nis located in the ATP binding site, stabilizing the ATP-\\nloaded complex (DFG-in) and αC helix (αC-in). In the \\ninactive state, EGFR forms a Src-like structure, including \\na closed A-loop, αC-out, and DFG-in [2]. (Fig.\\xa0 1B). EGFR \\ncan dimerize upon binding by ligands, such as amphireg -\\nulin, β-cytokines, epidermal growth factor (EGF), Open Access\\n†Kunyu Shi, Guan Wang and Junping Pei contributed equally to this work\\n*Correspondence:  ouyangliang@scu.edu.cn; yuxiwang@scu.edu.cn; \\nweimi003@scu.edu.cn\\n1 Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Targeted Tracer \\nResearch and Development Laboratory, Institute of Respiratory Health, \\nInnovation Center of Nursing Research, Nursing Key Laboratory of Sichuan \\nProvince, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China\\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlePage 2 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

The activation of the \\nintracellular tyrosine kinase domain and autophospho -\\nrylation, which initiates the Ras/RAF/MEK, signal trans -\\nducer and activator of transcription (STAT), PI3K/AKT/\\nmTOR and other downstream signaling pathways, are \\nclosely related to embryonic development and stem cell \\ndivision [2–4]. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) EGFR \\nprotein with or without EGFR gene amplification or a \\nkinase-activating mutation further enhances cell prolif -\\neration, migration, survival, and antiapoptotic responses \\nthrough signaling cascades, and these processes are \\nclosely related to the occurrence and development of many types of epithelial-derived cancer, such as non-\\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, glioma, \\nhead and neck cancer, cervical cancer, and bladder can -\\ncer. Among these cancers, lung cancer appears to be the \\nmost common and has the characteristics of aberrant \\nproliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance [5–8]. Thus, \\nEGFR has become a promising target for anticancer drug \\ndesign and development. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibi -\\ntors (EGFR-TKIs) have achieved remarkable results in \\nthe clinic [9]. However, most patients develop acquired \\ndrug resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-\\nTKIs after 1–2\\xa0years. The mechanism of drug resistance \\nfor nearly half of cases relates to the T790M mutation. \\nFig. 1 Structure and functions of EGFR.

In addition \\nto common secondary (T790M) and tertiary (C797S) \\nmutations, other EGFR mutations (such as the L718Q, \\nL796S, and L792H mutations and the exon 20 inser -\\ntion), MET amplification, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bis -\\nphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) \\nmutations, HER2 amplification, oncogene fusions, and \\nalterations in cell cycle-related genes have been observed \\n[11] (Fig.\\xa0 1C). There is an urgent need for better strate -\\ngies to combat the inevitable molecular-targeted drug \\nresistance associated with third-generation inhibitors. \\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of \\nthe mechanisms of resistance to third-generation EGFR-\\nTKIs and to explore new insights and strategies for over -\\ncoming acquired resistance.\\nThird‑generation EGFR‑TKIs and\\xa0drug resistance \\nmechanisms\\nThe development of\\xa0third‑generation EGFR‑TKIs\\nThe first-generation EGFR-TKIs form hydrogen bonds \\nwith Met793 in the ATP binding pocket of EGFR and \\nreversibly compete with ATP for binding. Drug resistance \\noccurs due to the EGFR T790M mutation (Thr790 in the \\nhydrophobic ATP binding site encoded on exon 20 is \\nreplaced by methionine), subclonal selection (of a geneti -\\ncally resistant clone), and rare EGFR mutations (such \\nas G719X, S768I, and L861Q). Thereafter, the develop -\\nment of second-generation EGFR-TKIs was reported; \\nthese inhibitors have the same quinazoline scaffold as \\nfirst-generation EGFR-TKIs, but the side chain can irre -\\nversibly bind to Cys797 to inhibit the tyrosine kinase \\nactivity of EGFR. For example, the anilinoquinazoline derivative forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone \\nof Met793 in the hinge region and interacts with the \\nhydrophobic region. The acrylamide group binds cova -\\nlently to Cys797 in the active conformation of EGFR, the \\nfuranyl group is exposed to solvent, and the 3-chloro-\\n4-fluorophenyl group is situated next to the gatekeeper \\nresidue [12–14]. However, mutations such as T790M still \\nemerge upon treatment with second-generation EGFR-\\nTKIs, which have limited selectivity against WT-EGFR, \\nresulting in serious side effects [15]. Fortunately, third-\\ngeneration covalent inhibitors that bind irreversibly to \\nthe target and are mutation-selective have been devel -\\noped. These compounds were designed based on a new \\naminopyrimidine scaffold and show preferable biological \\nactivities [16]. Early clinical trials have proven that these \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs are effective in patients \\nwith double-mutated tumors (EGFR L858R/T790M or \\nex19del/T790M) and have high selectivity for mutant \\nEGFR, thereby eliminating the side effects in the skin \\nand gastrointestinal system associated with the nonselec -\\ntive inhibition of WT-EGFR [17]. For example, the crys -\\ntal structures of rociletinib (CO-1686) in complex with \\nEGFR T790M and EGFR L858R have been published; in \\nEGFR T790M, the anilinopyrimidine group of rociletinib \\nforms hydrogen bonds with the Met793 amide and the \\ncarbonyl backbone, whereas in EGFR L858R, hydropho -\\nbic interactions between rociletinib and the protein were \\ndue to hydrogen bonds between nitrogens in the pyrimi -\\ndine group and between the fluoromethyl and Thr790. \\nIn addition, the acrylamide group in rociletinib cova -\\nlently binds to Cys797 in the DFG-in/αC-in active con -\\nformations [18]. The specificity for EGFR T790M may \\nstem from hydrophobic interactions between the large \\nmethionine in mutant EGFR and pyrimidines. Drugs that \\nhave been approved for marketing include osimertinib \\n(US), almonertinib (China), lazertinib (South Korea), and \\nalflutinib (China) (Fig.\\xa02).\\nFig. 2 Development of third-generation EGFR-TKIsPage 4 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\nMechanisms of\\xa0resistance to\\xa0third‑generation EGFR‑TKIs\\nDue to the covalent bond between the acrylamide \\n(Michael acceptor) of third-generation EGFR-TKIs \\nand the active thiol in the EGFR kinase domain, highly \\nselective inhibitory activity has been achieved by target -\\ning Cys797 and irreversible binding EGFR; thus, these \\ncompounds show excellent antitumor activity. Targeted \\ntherapy for patients with EGFR T790M and EGFR-acti -\\nvating mutations showed good efficacy in both first- and \\nsecond-line settings. In patients who developed resist -\\nance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs as first-line ther -\\napy, genetic changes such as MET amplification, EGFR \\nC797X mutation, PIK3CA amplification and mutation, \\nHER2 amplification and mutation, K-RAS mutation, and \\nBRAF mutation, as well as changes in cell cycle-related \\ngenes and oncogene fusions, have been reported, but no \\nT790M mutations have been detected. The mechanism of resistance to second-line therapy is more compli -\\ncated. Acquisition or deletion of the T790M mutation \\nhas been detected in patients [19], and other EGFR muta -\\ntions (such as L718Q, L796S, L792H, and exon 20 inser -\\ntion) have also been observed (Fig.\\xa0 1B). In addition, the \\nmechanisms of acquired resistance to third-generation \\nEGFR-TKIs include alternative pathway activation and \\nhistologic and phenotypic transformation (Fig.\\xa0 3); the \\ndetails will be discussed in the following sections.\\nPrimary/intrinsic resistance\\nThe differential sensitivity of TKIs to different EGFR \\nmutations is a cause of primary drug resistance. In \\nNSCLC patients, the in-frame deletion of exon 19 \\n(ex19del) and the L858R point mutation in exon 21 \\nare the most common somatic mutations, occur -\\nring in approximately 80% of cases. During EGFR-TKI \\nFig. 3 Molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance. The mechanisms include target gene modification, parallel alternative pathway activation, \\ndownstream pathway activation, and histological/phenotypic transformation. Both amplification and mutation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) \\ncan induce downstream survival signaling pathways. Moreover, direct overexpression and/or mutation of components of downstream pathways \\ncan contribute to acquired resistance by promoting cancer cell survivalPage 5 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\ntreatment, patients with longer median survival have \\npresented with more than 20 unique deletions of exon \\n19. Intrinsic drug resistance can all be triggered by \\nother nonclassical sensitizing mutations (mainly exon \\n20 insertion) and inherent secondary genetic changes. \\nDrug-resistant clones (for example, T790M) may \\nalready exist within the cancer cell population, leading \\nto drug resistance during treatment [20]. Some studies \\nhave found that in nearly 1% of lung cancer patients, \\n2–3 simultaneous driver mutations can be detected \\nbefore treatment. Some molecular and genetic changes \\nhave been reported to relate to intrinsic drug resist -\\nance, such as the lack of K-RAS/phosphatase and tensin \\nhomolog (PTEN) expression. These preexisting molec -\\nular and genetic alterations can stimulate the Ras/Raf/\\nMEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT downstream pathways to \\npromote cancer progression [21].\\nBIM deletion polymorphism\\nBIM is a proapoptotic member of the B-cell lym -\\nphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family [22]. Recent studies showed \\nthat lung cancer cells with the BIM deletion polymor -\\nphism and EGFR mutation are resistant to third-gen -\\neration EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that the BIM deletion \\npolymorphism has potential as a biomarker to predict \\nthe efficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKIs in patients \\n[22].\\nEGFR exon 20 insertion\\nThe molecular mechanism of drug resistance caused by \\nthe exon 20 insertion is not fully understood. Eck et\\xa0 al. \\n[23] hypothesized that this mutation prevents binding to \\nEGFR-TKIs due to the addition of residues to the N-lobe \\nof EGFR. The crystal structure of EGFR exon 20 with the \\nD770_N771insNPG insertion shows an unchanged ATP \\nbinding pocket and a rigid active conformation, leading \\nto steric hindrance of the drug binding pocket and resist -\\nance to EGFR-TKIs.\\nAcquired resistance\\nAcquired drug resistance refers to the process by which \\ntumor cells with prior sensitivity to treatment circum -\\nvent the inhibitory effects of drugs by changing their \\nmetabolic pathways. The mechanisms of acquired resist -\\nance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs can be divided into \\nEGFR-dependent resistance and EGFR-independent \\nresistance [24].EGFR‑dependent drug resistance mechanisms\\nReappearance of\\xa0an\\xa0EGFR mutation\\nC797S mutation\\nOne point mutation of EGFR (C797S) involves the \\nreplacement of Cys797 within the ATP binding site \\n(exon 20) with serine [25]. Osimertinib binds covalently \\nand irreversibly to EGFR T790M by interacting with \\nCys797. When the C797S mutation occurs, the osi -\\nmertinib binding efficiency decreases [10], resulting in \\ntumor resistance to all third-generation EGFR-TKIs.\\nG796R/D mutation\\nThe G796R mutation has been detected in cancer \\npatients who received treatment with a third-gen -\\neration EGFR-TKI. Molecular docking predictions \\nrevealed that G796R sterically hinders the covalent \\nbinding of osimertinib. Because the bulky side chain \\nand hydrophilic group hinder the binding of osimerti -\\nnib to the hydrophobic region, the change in binding \\nenergy renders binding unfavorable. Compared with \\nsamples containing the double-mutant EGFR L858R/\\nT790M, those harboring the triple-mutant EGFR \\nL858R/T790M/G796R are 110 times more resistant \\nto osimertinib [26]. G796D was reported for the first \\ntime in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC patients. In\\xa0vitro \\nstudies have shown that the G796D mutation causes \\na 50-fold increase in the growth inhibitory 50%  (GI50) \\nvalue of osimertinib. Structural modeling showed that \\nthe side chain of the mutated G796D residue collides \\nwith the surface of osimertinib, resulting in steric hin -\\ndrance and energy repulsion and ultimately the loss of \\nbinding affinity [27].\\nL792 mutation\\nThe mutations at Leu792 include L792F, L792Y, and \\nL792H. Structural prediction revealed that these muta -\\ntions introduce a benzene ring or imidazole ring to the \\nside chain of the residue at 792, which spatially dis -\\nrupts the orientation of osimertinib, thereby potentially \\naffecting the binding of osimertinib to the EGFR ATP \\nbinding site [28].\\nM766Q mutation\\nThe homology simulation with the T790M and M766Q \\ndouble mutant showed that M766Q seems to position \\nT790M in the inhibitor binding site, thereby weakening \\nosimertinib binding [29].\\nMutations in\\xa0exon 18\\nEGFR L718Q/V EGFR L718Q was reported for the first \\ntime in a cell model of resistance to third-generation \\nEGFR-TKIs. Subsequent studies have shown that NSCLC Page 6 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\nwith EGFR L858R/T790M/L718Q is resistant to all EGFR-\\nTKIs, but that with only L858R/L718Q remains sensitive \\nto afatinib [30]. The crystallographic model revealed that \\nthe L718Q mutation reduces the efficiency of the forma -\\ntion of covalent bonds between the acrylamide warhead \\nand the Cys797 thiol group, thus interfering with the irre -\\nversible binding of osimertinib [31, 32]. In addition, L718V \\nresistance mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR have \\nbeen detected, and these may interfere with the binding \\nof osimertinib to the kinase domain [33]. Of note, EGFR \\nL718Q/V is still sensitive to afatinib [32].\\nEGFR G724S The G724S mutation in the ATP binding \\nloop enriches this loop in glycine, which can lead to the \\ndevelopment of resistance to EGFR-TKIs by changing the \\nprotein structure, enhancing ATP affinity, and stabilizing \\nactivating mutations [34]. However, this mutation does \\nnot lead to resistance to second-generation EGFR inhibi -\\ntors [34].\\nCompound mutations\\nA compound mutation refers to the simultaneous detec -\\ntion of two or more different types of EGFR mutations in \\npatient cancer cells [35]. The impact of compound muta -\\ntions on EGFR-TKI sensitivity is listed in descending \\norder: double classic mutations, compound mutations \\ninvolving classic mutations and rare mutations, and com -\\npound mutations of only rare mutations [36, 37]. These \\nEGFR mutations caused by treatment with third-genera -\\ntion EGFR-TKIs confer resistance to irreversible pyrimi -\\ndine TKIs but not to quinazoline EGFR inhibitors [38].\\nT790M reduction or\\xa0deletion\\nDeletion of T790M may result from third-generation \\nEGFR-TKI treatment or may be one of the reasons \\nfor drug resistance related to tumor heterogeneity. In \\npatients with EGFR T790M, resistance mechanisms are \\noften associated with the C797S mutation or aberrant \\nactivation of compensatory pathways, whereas patients \\nwith the deletion of T790M typically exhibit different \\nresistance mechanisms, most of which are not associated \\nwith EGFR signaling pathways [39].\\nEGFR amplification\\nPiotrowska and colleagues reported EGFR T790M allele \\namplification in rociletinib-resistant clones [40]. Nukaga \\net\\xa0al. found that amplification of the WT allele of EGFR is \\nsufficient to mediate resistance to third-generation TKIs. \\nThe mechanism of drug resistance may be that EGFR \\ngene amplification leads to a relatively low TKI concen -\\ntration that is insufficient to exert inhibitory activity [41].EGFR‑independent resistance mechanisms\\nNot all patients develop resistance to TKIs through \\nEGFR mutation; other pathways of acquiring resistance \\nto third-generation EGFR-TKIs include the activation \\nof alternative or downstream signaling pathways, epi -\\nthelial interstitial resistance, epithelial–mesenchymal \\ntransition (EMT), histologic and phenotypic transfor -\\nmation, oncogene fusion, and cell cycle-related gene \\nabnormalities.\\nBypass signal pathway activation\\nAbnormal activation of\\xa0MET\\nThere are two main drug resistance mechanisms caused \\nby the abnormal activation of MET: the MET exon 14 \\nskipping mutation (METex14) and MET amplification. \\nMETex14 leads to the loss of ubiquitin ligase binding \\nsites, a reduction in receptor ubiquitination, and per -\\nsistent MET activation, resulting in tumor cell survival \\nand acquired resistance [42]. After treatment with \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs, MET gene amplification \\ncan promote drug resistance by activating MAPK/ERK, \\nwhich is independent of EGFR [43].\\nHER2 amplification\\nHus et\\xa0al. found that H1975 cells expressing HER2D16 \\nwere resistant to osimertinib in\\xa0 vitro. HER2D16 can \\nform a heterodimer with EGFR or a disulfide homodi -\\nmer, which activates downstream signaling to achieve \\nresistance to osimertinib [44]. HER2D16-driven drug \\nresistance occurs in a manner unrelated to the kinase \\nSrc. In addition, other mutations in exon 20 of HER2 \\nhave been reported, including point mutations (such \\nas G776C and L755S) and insertions that cause down -\\nstream activation [45, 46]. HER2 mutation occurs in \\napproximately 2–4% of NSCLC cases, mostly in lung \\nadenocarcinoma (LUAD) [47]. In NSCLC, HER2 onco -\\ngenic amplification occurs in approximately 3% of cases \\nwithout EGFR-TKI treatment and accounts for approx -\\nimately 10% of cases with EGFR-TKI resistance [48].\\nAXL activation\\nAXL is an RTK that regulates cell survival, proliferation, \\nmetastasis, and other cellular functions. Abnormalities \\nin the AXL gene can generate acquired resistance to \\nTKIs by activating relevant downstream signaling path -\\nways. Osimertinib was found to trigger AXL activation \\nby closing the negative feedback loop with SPRY4, thus \\ntriggering inherent osimertinib resistance [49].\\nOverexpression of\\xa0HGF\\nHepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the ligand of the \\nproto-oncogene c-Met; it can trigger MET activation Page 7 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\nthrough EGFR bypass signaling and induce lung can -\\ncer resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Yano et\\xa0al. [50] found that \\nhigh expression of HGF was related to the acquired \\nand intrinsic drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients \\nwith lung cancer. Tumor specimens from patients \\nwith acquired drug resistance showed high expression \\nof HGF in the context of MET amplification and the \\nT790M mutation.\\nFibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling\\nFGFR is a transmembrane RTK. Studies have shown that \\nFGFR1 is amplified and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) \\nmRNA levels are increased in patients with osimertinib \\nresistance, suggesting that the FGFR2-FGFR1 autocrine \\nloop may be related to drug resistance [51]. Patients with \\nthe T790M mutation have been reported to show disease \\nprogression after treatment with osimertinib and nilo -\\ntinib. The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion was detected in ctDNA \\n[52, 53]. These findings suggest that abnormalities in the \\nFGFR signaling pathway may underlie the mechanism of \\nacquired resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs.\\nInsulin‑like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R)\\nIGF1R, a transmembrane heterotetrameric protein \\nencoded by the gene located on chromosome 15q26.3, is \\ninvolved in promoting the growth of tumor cells. Abnor -\\nmal activation of IGF1R leads to EGFR-TKI resistance \\n[54].\\nAurora kinases (AURKs)\\nAURKs are an important category of enzymes within the \\nserine/threonine kinase family consisting of three mam -\\nmalian isoforms: Aurora kinase A (AURK A), AURK B, \\nand AURK C [55, 56]. AURK A and AURK B are highly \\nexpressed in dividing cells and play important roles in \\nmitotic progression. Mammalian AURK A and AURK B \\nshare approximately 71% similarity in the carboxy-termi -\\nnal catalytic domain [57]. Aberrant expression of AURK \\nA and AURK B is involved in a broad range of solid can -\\ncers and is associated with adverse prognosis and drug \\nresistance [58, 59]. In addition, Tanaka et\\xa0al. [60] reported \\nthat targeting AURK B can prevent and overcome resist -\\nance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer by enhancing \\nBIM- and PUMA-mediated apoptosis.\\nDownstream signaling pathway activation\\nThe activation of signaling pathways downstream of \\noncogenic receptors can regulate cell proliferation, cell \\ncycle progression, and cell survival. Therefore, the direct \\nregulation of downstream signaling pathway-related fac -\\ntors can lead to acquired resistance.K‑RAS mutation\\nAn epidemiological meta-analysis found that K-RAS \\nmutations are present in NSCLC patients, and all \\npatients with K-RAS mutations were resistant to EGFR-\\nTKIs [61]. K-RAS mutation is related to activation of \\nthe RAS-MAPK pathway. The common K-RAS muta -\\ntions include G12S, G12D, G12A, Q61H, and A146T. \\nStudies have found that inhibiting mutant K-RAS can \\nreduce tumor growth and render NSCLC patients sen -\\nsitive to EGFR inhibitors [62].\\nBRAF (v‑RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1) \\nmutation\\nBRAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays \\na key role in the MAPK/ERK pathway, including in \\nEGFR/RAS/RAF signal transduction. BRAF can regu -\\nlate cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and \\napoptosis, as well as tumor induction. Many BRAF \\nmutations (G469A, V600E, and V599E) have been \\nfound in cancer, including lung cancer [63]. Ohashi \\net\\xa0 al. [64] reported that in patients with lung cancer, \\nBRAF mutations can induce acquired resistance to \\nEGFR-TKIs. Preclinical data showed that the BRAF \\nV600E mutation has a strong association with resist -\\nance to the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib in \\npatients with T790M-mutated LUAD.\\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR\\nPIK3CA is a driver gene of LUAD. Mutation of PIK3CA \\ncan promote tumor cell invasion and increase the activ -\\nity of downstream PI3Ks. Studies have shown that \\nPIK3CA amplification or mutation (including E453K, \\nE545K, and H1047R) may occur in patients with osi -\\nmertinib resistance [52, 65]. Increased PI3K activity \\nleads to the activation of various downstream kinases, \\nthereby increasing PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activ -\\nity in the absence of coupling to upstream EGFR \\nphosphorylation.\\nSTAT3 activation\\nSTAT proteins, especially STAT3, are key down -\\nstream signal sensors of EGFR activation. In studies \\non NSCLC, Zhao et\\xa0al. [66] discovered the clinical sig -\\nnificance of JAK2/STAT3 in angiogenesis.

The c-Myc gene can induce cells to prolif -\\nerate indefinitely and can promote cell division; these \\nactivities are related to the occurrence and develop -\\nment of various types of cancer. Studies have shown that \\nc-Myc levels are substantially elevated in different EGFR-\\nmutant NSCLC cell lines with acquired resistance to the \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib compared with \\nthe corresponding parental cell lines; moreover, these \\nincreased levels cannot be reduced by osimertinib. Con -\\nsistently, c-Myc levels are elevated in the majority of \\nEGFR-mutant NSCLC tissues from patients who relapsed \\non EGFR-TKI treatment compared with the correspond -\\ning baseline c-Myc levels prior to treatment [70]. These \\nfindings indicate that c-Myc mediates the therapeutic \\nefficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKIs and the develop -\\nment of acquired resistance to these TKIs.\\nOther mechanisms\\nEpithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)\\nIn EMT, cancer cells lose their epithelial properties \\nthrough the loss of E-cadherin, leading to increased \\nvimentin expression and transformation into a mesen -\\nchymal phenotype. A previous study found that osimerti -\\nnib-resistant H1975 cells have EMT characteristics in the \\nabsence of other EGFR mutations [71]. EMT is a coor -\\ndinated process involving multiple regulatory factors, \\nsuch as EMT-induced transcription factors (EMT-TFs), \\nnoncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and various extracellular \\nsignals. EMT-TFs play an important role in all stages of \\nEMT; the most well-known EMT-TFs are members of \\nthe SNAIL, ZEB, and TWIST families. Many studies have \\nshown that SLUG and SNAIL overexpression can induce \\ndrug resistance [72].miRNAs and\\xa0EMT\\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs \\n(miRNAs) play important roles in regulating EMT and \\nTKI resistance. Although most miRNAs have been \\nfound to inhibit EMT, some have activity that pro -\\nmotes EMT, including miR-21 and miR-155 [73, 74]. \\nSome miRNAs can promote TKI resistance by activat -\\ning the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway; for exam -\\nple, miR-21 and miR-23a can target PTEN and activate \\nAKT, leading to resistance to EGFR-TKIs [75, 76].\\nEpigenetic alterations\\nEpigenetic modifications involved in cancer initiation \\nand progression include changes in DNA methylation \\npatterns and histone modifications. Epigenetic changes \\nare common in the development and progression of \\nlung cancer [77]. Studies have shown that epigenetic \\ndisorders can make cancer patients susceptible to \\nacquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs [78].\\nOncogene fusion\\nThe AURA-3 and FLAURA trials showed that onco -\\ngene fusion might be one mechanism of osimertinib \\nresistance; the identified fusions included transform -\\ning growth factor receptor (TGFR)-transforming acidic \\ncoiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), neurotrophic receptor \\ntyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1)-thrombopoietin mimetic \\npeptide 3 (TMP3), ERC1-RET, SPTBN1-ALK, coiled-\\ncoil domain-containing protein 6 (CCDC6)-RET, \\nGOPC-ROS1, AGK-BRAF, NCOA4-RET, ESYT2-BRAF, \\nand echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 \\n(EML4)-ALK. Oncogene fusions can coexist with the \\nEGFR C797S mutation, MET amplification, and BRAF \\nmutation [79].\\nCell cycle‑related gene abnormalities\\nRecent studies have shown that changes in cell cycle-\\nrelated genes, including the CDKN2A E27fs muta -\\ntion, cyclin D (CCND) amplification, cyclin-dependent \\nkinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) amplification, and cyclin E1 \\n(CCNE1) amplification, can cause resistance to third-\\ngeneration EGFR-TKIs [65].\\nHistologic and\\xa0phenotypic transformation\\nHistopathological transformation to small cell lung \\ncancer (SCLC) from NSCLC has been reported as a \\nmechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in \\n3–15% of patients [80– 83]. Transformed SCLC mainly \\noccurs in Asian patients with adenocarcinoma harbor -\\ning EGFR-TKI-sensitive mutations (such as the EGFR \\nex19del/T790M mutation) who are nonsmokers. The \\nwidely accepted hypothesis for this transformation Page 9 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\nposits that adenocarcinoma and SCLC originate from \\ntype II alveolar cells. RB1 and TP53 mutations might be \\ninvolved in SCLC transformation but are not sufficient \\nfor the induction of complete transformation. Addi -\\ntional genomic alterations, including those that acti -\\nvate the PI3K/AKT family and downregulate NOTCH \\nsignaling and those affecting the MYC and SOX fami -\\nlies, AKT pathway activation and other molecules, also \\nparticipate in the transformation from EGFR-mutant \\nNSCLC. However, the precise mechanisms in other \\ncases are unclear [84]. In addition, squamous cell trans -\\nformation was recently identified as a mechanism of \\nacquired EGFR-TKI resistance that occurs in approxi -\\nmately 15% of patients who received osimertinib as \\nboth first- and second-line therapy. Similar to the case \\nin SCLC transformation, the primary EGFR mutation is \\npreserved in squamous cell transformation [85].\\nImmune escape\\nEGFR is expressed in different hematopoietic cell types, \\nincluding macrophages, monocytes, and certain T-cell \\nsubsets. Therefore, it is likely that EGFR inhibitors can \\ninterfere with the function of these leukocytes. Immune \\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have adverse effects and \\npoor efficacy in patients with an EGFR mutation or a sec -\\nondary T790M mutation, largely because of low tumor \\nmutational burden and a noninflamed tumor micro -\\nenvironment [86–88]. A previous study showed that \\nsecreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) promotes macrophage \\nM2 polarization and PD-L1 expression in LUAD, which \\nmay influence the response to immunotherapy. SPP1 lev -\\nels might be a useful marker of immunosuppression in \\npatients with an EGFR mutation and could provide thera -\\npeutic insight [89]. In addition, HGF, MET amplification, \\nand EGFR T790M lead to the upregulation of PD-L1 \\nexpression in NSCLC and promote immune escape by \\ntumor cells through different mechanisms mediated by \\nthe PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB pathways [90].\\nStrategies for\\xa0overcoming third‑generation EGFR‑TKI \\nresistance\\nFourth‑generation EGFR‑TKIs: overcoming the\\xa0L858R/T790M \\nand\\xa0C797S resistance mutations\\nThird-generation EGFR-TKIs had the potential for \\nremarkable achievements, if not for the numerous \\nmutations. The C797S mutation, which is a covalent \\nanchor mutation, is located in the ATP binding site of \\nthe EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. This missense muta -\\ntion in exon 20 at position Cys797 blocks the ability of \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs to form a covalent bond \\nin the ATP binding region, with a consequent decrease \\nin the binding affinity between EGFR and an EGFR-\\nTKI [91]. The combination of the C797S mutation with exon 19 deletion, L858R mutation, or T790M muta -\\ntion was reported both in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo [91]. Studies \\nhave shown that drug-resistant lung cancer cells with \\ntwo mutations (EGFR-activating mutation/C797S) are \\nsensitive to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. \\nHowever, lung cancer cells with three mutations (EGFR-\\nactivating mutation/T790M/C797S) show resistant to \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs if the C797S and T790M \\nmutations are both in the trans conformation. None -\\ntheless, these cells are still sensitive to the combination \\nof first- and third-generation EGFR-TKIs [92]. Of note, \\nif C797S and T790M are mutated in the cis conforma -\\ntion, the cells show resistance to all existing EGFR-TKIs \\n(either alone or in combination) [93]. The resistance to \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs caused by the trans-C797S \\nmutation can be overcome by drugs targeting different \\nkinase binding sites, including allosteric inhibitors, ATP-\\ncompetitive inhibitors, and “dual-site” inhibitors that \\noccupy both the ATP binding site and an allosteric site.\\nAllosteric inhibitors\\nEGFR has three binding sites: an inactive site, a competi -\\ntive ATP binding site, and an allosteric site. Ligands and \\ndrugs cannot bind the inactive site. Recent studies have \\nmostly focused on either ATP-competitive inhibitors tar -\\ngeting the ATP binding site or molecules that bind the \\nallosteric site, which causes a conformational change in \\nthe protein that inhibits the signaling cascade [94]. To \\novercome the resistance of EGFR-TKIs mediated by the \\nT790M and C797S mutations and to further identify and \\nexplore compounds that bind outside the ATP binding \\ndomain of EGFR, researchers have pursued the devel -\\nopment of allosteric inhibitors, and this appears to be a \\npromising strategy. The newly developed fourth-gen -\\neration mutant-selective allosteric inhibitors can over -\\ncome the T790M and C797S mutations that develop in \\nresponse to third-generation EGFR-TKIs by binding to \\nsites outside the ATP binding pocket of EGFR.\\nFig. 4 Screening hit 1a (1) from a phenotypic screen of NSCLC \\ncell lines. A Structure of 1a (1). B X-ray crystal structure of 1a (1) in \\ncomplex with c-Src-DM (PDB code: 5D12)Page 10 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\nThrough molecular phenotypic screening, Engel et\\xa0 al. \\nobtained quinazoline compound 1a (1), which specifi -\\ncally inhibits the drug-resistant H1975 cell line (L858R/\\nT790M); further modification addressed the problem of \\noff-target activity (nonspecific inhibition). X-ray crystal -\\nlography verified that compound 1a (1) fits well in the \\ntyrosine kinase domain of c-Src [95] (Fig.\\xa04).\\nJia et\\xa0 al. conducted counter-screening of active com -\\npounds against WT-EGFR and discovered the first non-\\nATP-competitive allosteric EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S \\ninhibitor based on the thiazolamide scaffold (EAI001, \\n2) [96]. The X-ray crystal structure of EAI001 (2) in \\ncomplex with EGFR T790M shows that EAI001 (2) can \\nbind to the allosteric site of this receptor in the form of \\na “three-bladed propeller, ” partly due to the outward \\ndisplacement of the C-helix in the inactive conforma -\\ntion of the kinase. The hydrophilic side chain of the WT \\ngatekeeper residue (Thr) cannot adapt to the thiazole of \\nEAI001; therefore, there is no favorable interaction. The \\nthiazole of EAI001 closely interacts with the hydrophobic \\nside chain of Met790; specifically, aminothiazole group \\nof EAI001 directly binds to Met790. The carbonyl oxy -\\ngen of the isoindoline-1-one moiety is inserted between \\nthe mutant gatekeeper residue (Met) and the active site \\nresidue Lys745, forming another hydrogen bond with \\nthe ε-amine of the Lys745 side chain. The NH group of \\nformamide acts as a hydrogen bond donor for Asp855 \\nin the DFG motif. The cationic phenyl group occupies \\nthe hydrophobic pocket formed by Met766, Leu777, \\nand Phe856. The 1-oxindolinyl group is exposed along \\nthe C-helix and extends to the solvent-accessible area. \\nThe ATP analog adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-\\nPNP) binds the active site cavity in an expected man -\\nner. The half maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC50) of \\nEAI001 (2) for EGFR L858R/T790M is 24\\xa0nmol/L, which \\nis lower than that for WT-EGFR  (IC50 > 50\\xa0μmol/L). The \\n IC50s of EAI001 (2) for EGFR L858R and EGFR T790M \\nis 0.75\\xa0 μmol/L and 1.7\\xa0 μmol/L, respectively. By intro -\\nducing ortho-hydroxyl and meta-fluorine atoms on the \\nbenzene ring of EAI001 (2), the researchers synthesized \\nanother compound, EAI045 (3), that binds more tightly \\nthan EAI001 (2) to EGFR [96]. However, EAI045 has a \\nmajor drawback: it must be used in combination with \\ncetuximab to preserve its efficacy. While EAI045 (3) has \\ngood selectivity for WT-EGFR, cetuximab is expected \\nto have off-target effects in clinical use. Lee et\\xa0 al. [97] \\ndesigned the EGFR allosteric inhibitor TREA-0236 (4) \\nbased on the structure–activity relationships of EAI045 \\n(3). The structure of EAI045 (3) was modified by cycliza -\\ntion, wherein the 2-aminothiazole amide was converted \\nto quinazoline-4-one. To minimize hematological and \\nmethemoglobinemia toxicity and to obtain better safety \\nand pharmacokinetic parameters, To et\\xa0 al. linked the 5-indole substituent to the isoindolinone of EAI001 (2) \\nand obtained a new EGFR allosteric compound, JBJ-02-\\n112-05 (5), with an  IC50 of 15\\xa0nmol/L for EGFR L858R/\\nT790M [98]. Additionally, EAI045 (3) was further opti -\\nmized to generate another EGFR allosteric inhibitor, JBJ-\\n04-125-02 (6), in which the 2-hydroxy-5-fluorophenyl \\nof EAI045 (3) was combined with the phenylpiperazine \\non isoindolinone. This compound showed a significantly \\nincreased ability to inhibit EGFR L858R/T790M, with \\nan  IC50 of 0.26\\xa0 nmol/L. Interestingly, combination with \\nosimertinib enhanced the efficacy of JBJ-04-125-02 (6) \\nand improved the targeting of JBJ-04-125-02 (6) to can -\\ncer cells [98], indicating that the combined use of cova -\\nlent mutant-selective ATP-competitive inhibitors and \\nEGFR allosteric inhibitors may be an effective treatment \\nstrategy for patients with EGFR-mutant disease (Fig.\\xa0 5). \\nEncouraged by the advantages of inhibiting allosteric \\nsites in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, researchers \\nhave extensively designed and optimized allosteric inhib -\\nitors for EGFR [98–101], as shown in Table\\xa01.\\nThe novelty of allosteric sites has attracted the atten -\\ntion of researchers, and these sites have become the \\nmost promising targets for the development of drugs \\nfor NSCLC and other diseases. Fourth-generation \\nEGFR-TKIs require further investigation and devel -\\nopment so that they are suitable as single-agent drugs \\ntargeting EGFR ex19del/T790M/C797S [98]. Allosteric \\ninhibitors have now entered the stage of rapid develop -\\nment and are expected to enter clinical trials soon, with \\nthe goal of benefitting more patients.\\nATP‑competitive inhibitors\\nATP-competitive inhibitors form one to three hydro -\\ngen bonds with amino acids in the hinge region of the \\ntarget kinase, thereby mimicking the characteristic \\nhydrogen bonds formed by the adenine ring of ATP . \\nThis type of inhibitor usually consists of a heterocy -\\nclic ring system that occupies the purine binding site, \\nwhere it acts as a side chain scaffold that occupies the \\nadjacent hydrophobic regions I and II. A high physio -\\nlogical or intracellular concentration of ATP may block \\nthe phosphotransferase activity of the target.

In addi -\\ntion, an N-(4-methoxyphenyl)acrylamide warhead was \\nintroduced to produce compound 37, and the influence \\nof the C797-targeting capacity of these chimeric com -\\npounds, which are expected to form a covalent bond with \\nC797, was assessed. The X-ray cocrystal analysis of the \\nbinding mode with EGFR T790M/V948R (Fig.\\xa0 7) revealed \\nthat compounds 34 and 36 bind in the same way. Taking \\ncompound 36 as an example, the aminopyridine moiety \\nforms a hydrogen bond with the M793 residue in the \\nhinge region. The inhibitor is anchored at the ATP bind -\\ning site, and the N atom of the imidazole moiety forms \\na hydrogen bond with K745, which is essential for the \\nstrong reversible binding of the imidazole skeleton. The \\nphenylamide bond extending into the allosteric pocket \\nis directed toward the T790M mutation, and the N atom \\non the amide forms hydrogen bonds with the T854 and \\nD855 residues. Despite considerable efforts, the X-ray \\ncrystal structure of compound 37 in complex with EGFR \\nwas not obtained. Compound 37 was computationally \\ndocked to the EGFR T790M/V948R kinase domain, and \\nthe result was the same as that for compound 36. The \\nmethoxyphenyl acrylamide formed a covalent bond with \\nC797. Importantly, no covalent binding of compound 37 \\nto the EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S kinase domain was \\nobserved, confirming that this compound is a noncova -\\nlent inhibitor.\\nThe inhibitory activity of the above compounds \\nwas tested, and the results showed that compound 34 \\nexhibited strong inhibitory activity against all mutants, \\nwith  IC50 values of 5–32\\xa0 nmol/L, indicating that the \\nintroduction of 2-fluoro-5-hydroxyphenyl alone did \\nnot increase selectivity. With the introduction of oxy -\\nisoindolin-2-yl, the inhibitory activity of compound 35 \\ndecreased, but a certain inhibitory effect against EGFR \\nL858R was observed. Furthermore, compound 1 inhib -\\nited all three EGFR mutants at the low nanomolar range. \\nCompound 37 showed a moderate degree of mutation \\nselectivity for WT-EGFR, possibly due to the methoxy -\\nphenyl acrylamide group. To assess the kinase selectiv -\\nity of compound 37, a kinome screen including 335 WT \\nkinases was performed; compound 37 exhibited high \\nselectivity, with a selectivity score of 0.006 at an inhibi -\\ntor concentration of 1\\xa0 μmol/L. Next, the antiprolifera -\\ntive activity of these compounds was evaluated in Ba/F3 \\ncells stably transfected with WT-EGFR, EGFR L858R, \\nEGFR L858R/T790M, or EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S. \\nAmong the compounds, compound 37 showed an anti -\\nproliferative effect in the EGFR L858R and EGFR L858R/\\nT790M cell lines, with  IC50 values in the micromolar \\nrange in the presence and absence of cetuximab. The \\n IC50 value of compound 37 in EGFR L858R Ba/F3 cells (1.2 ± 0.07\\xa0μmol/L) was comparable to that of EAI045 (3) \\ncombined with cetuximab (840 ± 700\\xa0nmol/L). Although \\ncompound 37 is potent and selective for kinases, its cellu -\\nlar activity is suboptimal. Kinase selectivity was achieved \\nby increasing the molecular weight of the lead compound \\nand increasing the number of hydrogen bond donors and \\nacceptors, but these changes may have produced limited \\ncell permeability and effects on cell viability; thus, this \\ncompound lacked sufficient activity in cells expressing \\nEGFR L858R/T790M/C797S.\\nThe selective EGFR inhibitor (compound 37) designed \\nand developed in this study can bind to both the ATP site \\nand the allosteric site of the EGFR kinase domain. Adding \\nallosteric inhibitor elements to the compound skeleton at \\nthe ATP binding site contributes to the mutation selec -\\ntivity of these compounds. The designed compound 37 \\nhas good kinase activity but nonideal cell activity. Future \\nresearch and development could optimize the structure \\nof this lead compound to further enhance its cellular \\nactivity.\\nPROTAC technology\\nAllosteric EGFR degrader\\nResistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs is a major \\nobstacle to clinical targeted therapy. Due to changes \\nin the EGFR protein [123], some kinase inhibitors are \\nrestricted to the catalytic pocket [124]. A proteolysis-\\ntargeting chimera (PROTAC) induces the proteasomal \\ndegradation of the target by recruiting it to a specific E3 \\nligase. The eradication of EGFR protein from cancer cells \\nprovides a promising strategy for overcoming drug resist -\\nance. The allosteric EGFR degrader is a heterobifunc -\\ntional compound based on allosteric EGFR inhibitors. \\nIt includes a small molecule (protein-of-interest (POI) \\nligand) that binds the target protein and a small-molecule \\nE3 ligase ligand that recruits cereblon (CRBN), von Hip -\\npel–Lindau (VHL), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein \\n1 (cIAP1) or murine double minute 2 (MDM2). After the \\naddition of a linker connecting the two parts [125, 126], \\nthese chimeras can degrade mutant EGFR without affect -\\ning WT-EGFR.\\nCompared with classic “occupying” inhibitors, allos -\\nteric EGFR degraders can completely eliminate the \\nfunction of the target protein, thereby improving the \\nphenotypic potency. Moreover, since PROTAC mole -\\ncules usually do not require strong binding to targets or \\nlong-term retention to achieve protein degradation, the \\ndevelopment of drug-induced resistance mutations may \\nbe prevented. Compared with kinase inhibitors, PRO -\\nTACs have the advantages of activity at lower concentra -\\ntions, limited dose-dependent toxicity, and the potential \\nto overcome drug resistance and target drug refractory Page 20 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

These molecules have attracted con -\\nsiderable attention from academia and industry and \\nhave become an attractive therapeutic strategy in drug \\ndiscovery.\\nBased on EAI001 (2), a compound that buries deeply in \\nthe allosteric pocket [96], Jang et\\xa0al. introduced 1-(pyri -\\ndin-2-yl)piperazine at the 6 position of isoindolinone \\nand synthesized JBJ-07-149 (38), which has an  IC50 value \\nof 1.1\\xa0nmol/L for EGFR L858R/T790M. In combination \\nwith cetuximab, JBJ-07-149 has a half maximal effective \\nconcentration  (EC50) of 0.148\\xa0 nmol/L for EGFR L858R/\\nT790M. However, this compound was less potent in the \\nproliferation assay  (EC50 = 4.9\\xa0nmol/L) [133].\\nBased on JBJ-07-149 (38), different linkers that bind \\nthe piperazine group and connect the CRBN ligand \\nwere evaluated. The compound with 3-PEG as the linker \\n(DDC-01-163, 39) showed the strongest antiproliferative activity for EGFR L858R/T790M (Fig.\\xa0 8). DDC-01-\\n163 (39) induced the selective degradation mutant \\nEGFR and inhibited the proliferation of cells expressing \\nmutant EGFR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. \\nDDC-01-163 (39) showed no activity in WT-EGFR Ba/\\nF3 cells  (EC50 > 10\\xa0 μmol/L) but inhibited the prolifera -\\ntion of EGFR L858R/T790M Ba/F3 cells, including those \\nexpressing EGFR L858R/T790M  (EC50 = 0.096\\xa0 μmol/L), \\nEGFR L858R/T790M/C797S  (EC50 = 0.041\\xa0 μmol/L) and \\nEGFR L858R/T790M/L718Q  (EC50 = 0.028\\xa0 μmol/L). \\nThe results in H1975 cells were consistent with those in \\nBa/F3 cells.

In addi -\\ntion, JBJ-07-200 (41)  (EC50 = 0.15\\xa0μmol/L) was obtained \\nby replacing the hydroxyl group of JBJ-04-125-02 (6) with \\nfluorine (Fig.\\xa0 9), which could potentially improve mem -\\nbrane permeability [133].

Qu et\\xa0 al. [135] demonstrated \\nfor the first time that in addition to the well-known ubiq -\\nuitin/proteasome pathway, the ubiquitin/autophagy/lyso -\\nsomal pathway participates in PROTAC-induced EGFR \\ndegradation. Based on the EGFR inhibitor canertinib \\n(41) and the CRBN ligand pomalidomide (an E3 ubiqui -\\ntin ligase ligand), researchers generated two novel EGFR \\nFig. 9 Chemical structures and EGFR inhibitory activities of EGFR-targeted PROTACs: the rational design of JBJ-07-200 (41)Page 22 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

Tumor cells readily gain drug resistance by \\nupregulating an alternative factor or transforming the \\nsignaling pathway that promotes proliferation; therefore, \\ntreatment focused on only a single target has limitations. \\nIn addition to its issues related to drug resistance, single-\\ntarget drugs also show reduced efficacy and can decrease \\nthe quality of life of patients due to side effects and tissue \\ntoxicity.\\nTo overcome the deficiencies of single-target drugs, \\nsingle hybrid molecules fused to two or more pharma -\\ncophores have been designed to simultaneously tar -\\nget two or more antitumor epitopes or targets. These \\nhybrid molecules can simultaneously modulate multi -\\nple targets or pathways and thus generally have better efficacy with fewer side effects. Based on this informa -\\ntion and inspired by the great success of dual-targeted \\ndrugs, especially dual-specific antibodies, Professor \\nLi et\\xa0al. combined the concepts of PROTACs and dual \\ntargeting; this group used trifunctional natural amino \\nacids as starlike core linkers to connect two inde -\\npendent inhibitors, gefitinib (44) and olaparib (45), \\nthat are linked to CRBN or VHL E3 ligands. The syn -\\nthesized novel dual PROTACs can successfully and \\nsimultaneously degrade EGFR and poly(ADP-ribose) \\npolymerase (PARP) in cancer cells [136]. Among the \\ndeveloped compounds, compound DP-V-4 (46) exhib -\\nited the best ability to degrade EGFR and PARP in a \\ndose- and time-dependent manner in H1299 cells and \\nFig. 11 Chemical structure and antiproliferative activity of the dual PROTAC DP-V-4 (46) (through the ubiquitin–proteasome system)Page 24 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

As \\nthe first successful example of a dual PROTAC, this \\nresearch will inject new vitality into the field of com -\\nbination therapy for cancer. Moreover, these findings \\nwill broaden the potential applications of the PROTAC \\nmethod, open new fields of drug discovery, and over -\\ncome the limitations of single-target therapy against \\nEGFR.\\nAnother new technology is the autophagy-targeting \\nchimera (AUTAC), a small molecule that targets protein \\ndegradation through autophagy and contains both a deg -\\nradation tag (guanine derivative) and a warhead to pro -\\nvide target specificity; AUTACs have a wider substrate \\npanel than the ubiquitin–proteasome system [137–139]. \\nTherefore, there is considerable potential for the design \\nand development of AUTAC molecules to degrade EGFR.\\nMonoclonal antibodies and\\xa0ADCs\\nFor patients with EGFR-mutant disease, there are tar -\\ngeted therapies for tumors harboring EGFR-TKI-sensi -\\ntizing mutations [140]. The EGFR monoclonal antibody \\ncan bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR to compete \\nwith EGF binding, thereby blocking downstream signal -\\ning. The variable fragment (Fv) is composed of parts of \\nthe light chain and heavy chain of the antibody and has \\nunique antigen recognition function. The constant region \\n(Fc) mediates innate immunity related to monoclonal \\nantibodies, mainly by binding immune factors or cells to exert antitumor effects. These properties make antibod -\\nies a favorable approach in targeted therapy, especially in \\ncombination with other strategies. In addition, the inter -\\nnalization and degradation of EGFR monoclonal anti -\\nbody and receptor complexes can downregulate EGFR on \\nthe surface of cancer cells. EGFR monoclonal antibodies \\nare now standard-of-care therapies for head and neck \\ncancer and colorectal cancer. Common EGFR monoclo -\\nnal antibodies include cetuximab, necitumumab, panitu -\\nmumab, matuzumab, and nimotuzumab. Antibody–drug \\nconjugates (ADCs) are composed of three moieties: the \\nantibody, linker, and drug (especially those with poten -\\ntial cytotoxicity) (Fig.\\xa0 12). Antibodies are equivalent to \\nprecise arrows, and highly active cytotoxic drugs (the \\npayload) correspond to the gunpowder on the arrows; \\nthese drugs mainly include tubulin inhibitors (monome -\\nthyl auristatin E, monomethyl auristatin F, mertansine, \\nand ravtansine) and DNA-damaging agents (those that \\ncause DNA double-strand breaks, DNA alkylation, DNA \\nintercalation, and DNA cross-linking). It is difficult to \\neffectively kill tumor cells with only cytotoxic drugs, but \\nmonoclonal antibodies alone are too inefficient. ADCs \\ncomposed of both the cytotoxic drug and a monoclonal \\nantibody represent a more powerful combination. ADCs \\ncan precisely target tumor cells by combining highly spe -\\ncific monoclonal antibodies with highly toxic cytotoxic \\ndrugs, thereby achieving a precise attack on EGFR-TKI-\\nresistant cancer cells and filling the gap between antibody \\nFig. 12 The mechanism of ADCsPage 25 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

Being precise and efficient, ADCs \\nhave therapeutic potential across cancer types and can \\nalso induce tumor cell death via the bystander effect \\n[141].\\nHe et\\xa0 al. developed a new ADC targeting EGFR, \\nnamely SHR-A1307 (47) (Fig.\\xa0 13), for the treatment of \\nsolid tumors resistant or refractory to EGFR-targeted \\ntherapy [142]. SHR-A1307 (47) has intermediate abil -\\nity to block EGFR affinity for hR3 and selectively binds \\nto cancer cells expressing EGFR while avoiding inhibi -\\ntory effects on normal cells. In addition to increasing stability and reducing systemic toxicity, Fc domain \\nengineering improved the pharmacokinetics. Although \\nless frequent drug administration may reduce toxin \\naccumulation, effective tumor cell killing with mini -\\nmal toxicity were observed. In addition, SHR-A1307 \\n(47) can effectively kill cancer cells that do not respond \\nto current EGFR inhibitors and shows low nanomolar \\nin\\xa0vitro cytotoxicity in a broad spectrum of cancer cells \\nwith different drug resistance mutations, thus provid -\\ning an attractive treatment opportunity to overcome \\nthe drug resistance of patients with EGFR-overexpress -\\ning tumors.\\nFig. 13 Chemical structure of ADCs targeting EGFR: SHR-A1307 (47) and MRG003 (48) (*Specific research data not disclosed)Page 26 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

In addition to activating mutations at the EGFR locus \\nthat lead to drug resistance, a large number of genetic \\nand epigenetic abnormalities may also lead to resistance \\nto third-generation EGFR-TKIs. The emergence of intrin -\\nsic and acquired resistance requires appropriate strate -\\ngies to prevent serious side effects. Combination therapy \\nhas additive or even synergistic effects, but due to vari -\\nous dose-limiting toxicities and drug–drug interactions \\ncaused by changes in pharmacokinetics, the simultane -\\nous use of two or more drugs in the clinic is challeng -\\ning. Therefore, as an alternative to combination therapy, \\ndrugs targeting two or more objects have a lower risk of \\ndrug–drug interactions and better pharmacokinetic and \\nsafety profiles, which helps mitigate poor patient compli -\\nance, off-target effects, and high development costs. Such \\ntreatment regimens are more flexible and can represent \\nan effective strategy for cancer therapy [166, 167]. The \\neffectiveness of multitarget kinase inhibitors of WT and/\\nor mutant EGFR has been extensively studied (Table\\xa0 5) \\n[59, 168–197]. Some EGFR-mutant cell lines are sensi -\\ntive to multitarget inhibition and maintain certain levels \\nof activity, highlighting the selectivity of multitarget com -\\npounds and suggesting that multitarget inhibition can be used to circumvent acquired multidrug resistance to \\nEGFR-targeted therapy without serious side effects.\\nNatural products\\nThe discovery of natural products offers new scaffolds for \\ndrug development.

Combination therapy with MCL-1 inhibi -\\ntors and osimertinib is a potential strategy to overcome \\nresistance. Bufalin (100) is a natural product that belongs \\nto the class of bufadienolide analogs.

They also discovered \\nthat glucose regulatory protein 94 (Grp94) protects \\nEGFR from degradation by blocking the binding of Fbxl2 \\nto EGFR. Through virtual screening of the DrugBank \\ndatabase, small compounds that can bind to the Fbxo3-\\napag domain were scored. Nebivolol (102) can be placed \\nin the dumbbell-shaped cavity of the APAG region. \\nThere are 5 amino acid residues in the center of this cav -\\nity (I331, E341, T367, T368 and F369); T367 and T368 \\nproject into the cavities of complementary shapes, form -\\ning hydrophobic interactions with the ligand. The bind -\\ning affinity of the Fbxo3 protein for endogenous Fbxl2 is \\ngreatly reduced when these five amino acids are mutated \\nindividually or in combination. Data suggest the potential \\nof nebivolol (102) as a small molecule that can disrupt \\nthe Fbxo3–Fbxl2 interaction. Increasing Fbxl2 levels with \\nnebivolol (102) (Fig.\\xa0 14) in combination with osimertinib \\nor a Grp94 inhibitor (ganetespib) to target the FBXL2-\\nGrp94-EGFR axis and thus destabilize EGFR is a possible \\ntherapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to third-gen -\\neration EGFR-TKIs [201].\\nAKR1B1 inhibitors\\nZhang et\\xa0al. discovered that aldehyde ketone reductase \\nfamily 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) interacts with STAT3 \\nand activates the cystine transporter solute carrier \\nfamily 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), which in turn leads \\nto enhanced cystine uptake, glutathione synthesis flux, \\nclearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protection \\nagainst cell death, and EGFR-TKI resistance. The use of \\nselective inhibitors (including the clinically approved \\nanti-diabetic drug epalrestat) to inhibit AKR1B1 can \\nrestore the sensitivity of drug-resistant cell lines to \\nEGFR-TKIs and delay drug resistance in mice har -\\nboring xenografted tumors derived from lung cancer \\npatients [202].\\nPGAM1 inhibitors\\nPhosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is an important \\nenzyme in the glycolysis pathway and is related to tumor \\ncell metastasis [203]. HKB99 (103) (Fig.\\xa0 14) is an allos -\\nteric inhibitor of PGAM1 that significantly inhibits the \\ngrowth and metastasis of NSCLC by affecting the meta -\\nbolic activity and nonmetabolic functions of PGAM1 \\n[204]. The docking model of the PGAM1-HKB99 com -\\nplex shows that HKB99 (103) binds to the allosteric site \\nof the adjacent substrate-binding pocket of PGAM1, thereby inhibiting the conversion of 3-PG to 2-PG and \\nsignificantly reducing the metabolic activity of PGAM1. \\nIn addition, HKB99 (103) can allosterically bind to \\nPGAM1, weaken the interaction between PGAM1 \\nand ACTA2, and inhibit the growth and metastasis of \\nerlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells [205, 206]. There -\\nfore, PGAM1 is a metabolic enzyme that may overcome \\nEGFR-TKI resistance.\\nNonoverlapping allosteric pockets—the X‑Pocket\\nQiu et\\xa0al. revealed the underlying mechanism of reverse \\nallosteric communication in dual-targeted therapy. Allos -\\nteric sites can be affected by orthomorphic drugs. The \\nnonoverlapping allosteric pocket X-Pocket was discov -\\nered in EGFR mutants; this pocket is mainly composed \\nof nonconserved residues, including the hot spots K867, \\nS895, and K960, that can cooperate with traditional TKIs \\n[207]. It is a promising target for the design of selective \\nconformationally restricted drugs, with great potential in \\nterms of affinity, efficacy, and selectivity.\\nDZ‑SIM inhibitors\\nIn addition, researchers found that a group of near-infra -\\nred heptamethine carbocyanine (DZ) fluorescent dyes, \\nthe prototype of which is heptamethylamine carbocya -\\nnine dye (IR-783) (104) (Fig.\\xa0 14), have tumor-targeting \\nactivity through differentially expressed organic anion \\ntransport peptides on cancer cells [208]. This group of \\norganic dyes can specifically deliver therapeutic pay -\\nloads to tumor cells in the form of chemical conjugates. \\nDZ-SIM was preliminarily synthesized; SIM specifi -\\ncally targets 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase \\n(HMGCR) in the endoplasmic reticulum. After specific \\nuptake by tumor cells, DZ-SIM was enriched in subcel -\\nlular organelles (including mitochondria and lysosomes). \\nNSCLC cells were killed by mitochondrial damage, which \\nmainly led to cytochrome C release into the cytoplasm, \\nthereby activating the caspase-3-dependent apoptosis \\ncascade. DZ-SIM inhibited the formation of cancer cell \\ncolonies resistant to first-generation (H1650 and H1975) \\nand third-generation EGFR-TKIs (PC9AR), and most \\n IC50 values were lower than 10\\xa0 μmol/L.

Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\nunclear resistance mechanisms, chemotherapy is still \\na treatment option. If the patient is asymptomatic or \\nhas symptomatic local progression, osimertinib can be \\ncombined with local treatment according to National \\nComprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. \\nCarboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and atezolizumab \\n(anti-PD-L1 antibody) are also options for patients \\nwho experience systemic progression after osimertinib \\ntreatment [209]. Whether chemotherapy can delay the \\ndevelopment of resistance to third-generation EGFR-\\nTKIs remains unknown. A study on osimertinib with or \\nwithout chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients \\nwith EGFR-mutant NSCLC is currently recruiting \\n(NCT04035486) [210].\\nFor most patients, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is not the \\nsole rate-limiting factor for antitumor immunity, and \\nblocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is insufficient to activate \\nan effective antitumor immune response [211]. Strate -\\ngies that lead to acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, such as \\nHGF, MET amplification, and EGFR T790M, also pro -\\nmote immune escape in lung cancer by upregulating \\nthe expression of PD-L1. Many combination strategies, \\nincluding α-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy, radio -\\ntherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, targeted therapy, other \\nICIs, agonists of the costimulatory molecule, stimula -\\ntor of interferon gene agonists, epigenetic modulators, \\nor metabolic modulators, have been confirmed to have \\nsuperior antitumor efficacy and a higher response rate. \\nThe immunomodulatory effect of chemotherapy sug -\\ngests that it might be a suitable partner for combina -\\ntion with α-PD-1/PD-L1 to achieve rapid and long-term \\ncancer control. During the KEYNOTE series of clini -\\ncal trials (such as KEYNOTE-021, KEYNOTE-189, and \\nKEYNOTE-407), pembrolizumab combined with stand -\\nard chemotherapy led to better overall survival (OS) and \\nprogression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients and \\nhas been approved by the FDA as first-line treatment for \\nadvanced nonsquamous NSCLC [212, 213]. In addition, \\nthe National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) \\napproved sintilimab plus gemcitabine and platinum as \\nfirst-line treatment for advanced squamous NSCLC \\nbased on the results of ORIENT-12 [214]. In addition \\nto α-PD-1-based approaches, α-PD-L1-based chemoim -\\nmunotherapy has also attracted intense attention. The \\nIMpower150 trial was the pioneer of this series of stud -\\nies, and the FDA-approved atezolizumab plus bevaci -\\nzumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as first-line treatment \\nfor advanced nonsquamous NSCLC [215]. Subsequently, \\nthe FDA-approved atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and \\ncarboplatin for nonsquamous NSCLC (based on the \\nresults of IMpower130). Radiotherapy can also induce \\nimmunogenic cell death and enhance the antitumor \\nimmune response. The results of a phase 1 study showed that α-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemoradiotherapy was toler -\\nable in advanced NSCLC (NCT02621398), with promis -\\ning clinical outcomes. In multiple clinical studies, such \\nas IMpower150, angiogenesis inhibitors enhanced the \\nefficacy of α-PD-1/PD-L1 [216]. Moreover, dual immune \\ncheckpoint blockade or costimulatory molecule agonists \\nplus α-PD-1/PD-L1 are also promising strategies. To date, \\nthe FDA has approved ipilimumab plus nivolumab for \\nNSCLC and melanoma, among others. Agonists target -\\ning costimulatory pathways such as CD27/CD70, CD40/\\nCD40L, and 4-1BB/4-1BBL could also enhance T-cell \\nactivity and restore the antitumor immune response. \\nHowever, bispecific/bifunctional antibodies simulta -\\nneously block two molecules and thus have a strategic \\nadvantage over combination therapy. For example, in the \\nphase 1 NCT03710265 trial, SHR-1701 (TGF-β × PD-L1 \\nbifunctional antibody) showed encouraging antitumor \\nactivity [217].\\nGiven the heterogeneity of mutations across patients, \\nthe selection of individualized combination treatment \\nstrategies could improve outcomes and mitigate treat -\\nment resistance.\\nDiscussion and\\xa0future perspectives\\nEGFR is an important target on tumor cells that pro -\\nmotes mitosis and transformation. It is overexpressed in \\nmany diseases and is particularly related to the occur -\\nrence and development of cancer [3, 7, 8]. Tumors often \\nhave prominent genomic and transcriptional hetero -\\ngeneity that is closely related to EGFR-TKI resistance \\n[40, 218]. Studies have shown that drug resistance can \\ndevelop through EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independ -\\nent mechanisms [24, 219]. The emergence of resistance to \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs limits the clinical benefits \\nfor patients, thus necessitating the further development \\nof more effective strategies.\\nTo date, fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs show promi -\\nnent antitumor activity. Recent research has shown that \\nfourth-generation inhibitors targeting allosteric sites \\nand ATP-competitive sites of EGFR can achieve remark -\\nable results against EGFR L858R/T790M and C797S. In \\naddition to fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs, combination \\ntreatments, monoclonal antibodies, and bispecific anti -\\nbodies are significantly contributing to the treatment of \\ntumors harboring the C797S mutation. While the C797S \\nmutation is only one of the numerous drug resistance \\nmechanisms, it is necessary to overcome other muta -\\ntions by designing and developing new noncovalent \\nATP-competitive inhibitors that form hydrogen bonds \\nwith mutated residues in the EGFR ATP pocket (such \\nas Lys745 and Asn842). The rational design of selective \\nEGFR inhibitors that bind to both the ATP and allosteric \\nsites of the EGFR kinase domain, that is, adding allosteric Page 38 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\ninhibitor elements to the compound skeleton at the ATP \\nbinding site, will help optimize and improve the mutation \\nselectivity of compounds and lead to the identification \\nof small molecules with good kinase inhibitory activity. \\nHowever, the cellular activity of such compounds needs \\nto be further improved, and future research directions \\nshould focus on the structural optimization of current \\nlead compounds to obtain EGFR inhibitors with better \\nmutation selectivity. Targeted protein degradation tech -\\nnology provides a new research direction for overcoming \\nresistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors. Consid -\\nering the significance of overcoming allosteric hindrance \\nby triple-mutant EGFR, allosteric EGFR degraders were \\ndeveloped. In addition, dual PROTACs have emerged in \\nthe field of cancer combination therapy; dual PROTACs \\ncan be designed with two targets, such as tumor immune \\ntargets plus adjuvant immune targets or energy metabo -\\nlism targets and epigenetic targets plus antiapoptotic tar -\\ngets, to further overcome resistance of third-generation \\nEGFR inhibitors and provide a better curative effect. Of \\ncourse, the larger molecular weight of dual PROTACs \\nwill affect their druggability and pharmacokinetics, \\nbut perhaps nanodrug delivery systems can be utilized \\nto improve drug absorption or optimized by simplify -\\ning the inhibitor moiety and maintaining the minimum \\npharmacophore. In addition, ADCs containing a small-\\nmolecule cytotoxic compound and a monoclonal anti -\\nbody targeting a cancer target have attracted attention. \\nThe ADC MRG003 has entered clinical trials with great \\ndevelopment and application prospects. The activation of \\nalternative pathways and histological transformation are \\nimportant mechanisms of resistance to third-generation \\nEGFR inhibitors. The combined use of third-generation \\ninhibitors and related pathway blockers is another impor -\\ntant approach. To prevent the toxicity and side effects of \\nmultidrug combinations, drugs with multiple pharmaco -\\nlogical activities were developed and proven to have more \\nadvantages than combination therapy. Multitarget kinase \\ndrugs have become a favorable choice due to their attrac -\\ntive pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety profiles. \\nNatural compounds have received much research atten -\\ntion due to their potential antitumor effects. Based on the \\nmolecular mechanism of inhibition, natural compounds \\ncan be modified to provide new insights for effectively \\novercoming resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs. \\nLast but not least, the discovery of EGFR degraders based \\non the FBXL2-Grp94-EGFR axis, AKR1B1 and PGAM1 \\ninhibitors, DZ-SIM, and the nonoverlapping allosteric \\npocket X-Pocket provides promising support for the fur -\\nther development of strategies to overcome resistance \\nto third-generation EGFR inhibitors. The mechanism of \\nresistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs is very com -\\nplex, is impacted by EGFR mutations, and differs among patients and tumor sites. Thus, next-generation sequenc -\\ning (NGS) of blood-based circulating tumor DNA \\n(ctDNA) or tissue samples to elucidate the resistance \\nmechanism will be valuable for guiding future therapeu -\\ntic approaches and for clinical research on novel combi -\\nnation therapies to overcome drug resistance. Moreover, \\nindividualized combination treatment strategies could \\nalso improve treatment efficacy and mitigate treatment \\nresistance.\\nEGFR is a verified target for antitumor therapy in a \\nbroad spectrum of cancers. Facilitated by versatile strate -\\ngies in the field of medicinal chemistry, better approaches \\nare anticipated for overcoming the hurdle of drug resist -\\nance to provide new hope for patients.\\nConclusion\\nAs a crucial “controller” that is related to the inhibi -\\ntion of tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, \\nmetastasis, and apoptosis, EGFR actively participates in \\nmalignant disease progression. However, the intrinsic \\nand acquired resistance in primary and recurrent can -\\ncer which is mediated by EGFR mutations after target \\ntreatment leads to difficult therapeutic. Understanding \\nthe complex resistance mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs and \\ndeveloping potential strategies to combat it could be of \\npotential interest for improving the individual therapeu -\\ntic strategies for cancer.\\nAbbreviations\\nACK1: Activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1; ADC: Antibody drug conjugates; \\nAKR1B1: Aldehyde–ketone reductase family 1 member B1; A-loop: Activation \\nloop; ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; AURK: Aurora kinases; AUTAC : Autophagy-\\ntargeting chimera; Bcl-2: B cell lymphoma-2; BRAF: V-RAF murine sarcoma \\nviral oncogene homolog B1; CCND: Cyclin D; CCNE1: Cyclin E1; CDK4/6: \\nCyclin-dependent kinase 4/6; cIAP1: Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1; \\nCRBN: Cereblon; DFG: Asp-Phe-Gly; DZ-SIM: DZ-SIMvastatin; EGF: Epidermal \\ngrowth factor; EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor; EGFR-TKIs: Epidermal \\ngrowth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors; EMT: Epithelial–mesen-\\nchymal transformation; EMT-TFs: EMT-induced transcription factors; ERC1: \\nExcision repair cross-complementation 1; FGF: Fibroblast growth factor; FGFR: \\nFibroblast growth factor receptor; Fv: Variable region fragment; Grp94: Glucose \\nregulatory protein 94; HB-EGF: EGF-like growth factor; HMGCR : 3-Hydroxy-\\n3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HNK: Honokiol; ICIs: Immune checkpoint \\ninhibitors; IGF1R: Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1; LUAD: Lung adenocar -\\ncinoma; MDM2: Mouse double minute 2; NCCN: National Comprehensive Can-\\ncer Network; NSCLC: Non-small cell lung cancer; NTRK1: Neurotrophic tyrosine \\nreceptor kinase 1; PARP: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PGAM1: Phosphoglycer -\\nate mutase 1; PIK3CA: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic \\nsubunit; PROTAC : Proteolysis-targeting chimera; PTEN: Phosphatase and tensin \\nhomolog; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; RTK: Receptor tyrosine kinase; SCLC: \\nSmall cell lung cancer; SLC7A11: Solute carrier family 7 member 11; SPP1: \\nSecreted phosphoprotein 1; STAT  : Signal sensor and transcription activator; \\nTACC3: Transforming acid helix protein 3; TGF: Transforming growth factor; \\nTMP3: Thrombopoietin mimetic peptide 3; VHL: Von Hippel–Lindau; WT: Wild-\\ntype; WT-EGFR: Wild-type EGFR.\\nAcknowledgements\\nNot applicable.Page 39 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

EGFR \\nis involved in multiple signaling pathways and regulates \\nnumerous cell functions (Fig.\\xa0 1A). This transmembrane \\nglycoprotein is composed of a cysteine-rich extracellu -\\nlar ligand binding domain, hydrophobic transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic RTK domain, and C-terminal \\ndomain. The RTK domain contains an N-lobe consist -\\ning of five β-sheet strands and one αC helix and a C-lobe \\ncontaining the main helices of a highly flexible activa -\\ntion loop (A-loop) [1]. The deep cleft at the junction of \\nthese two lobes forms the binding pocket for the adenine \\nring of ATP . The conformation of three conserved struc -\\ntural elements, namely the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, \\nαC helix, and A-loop, critically regulates the activation \\nor inactivation of the catalytic domain. When EGFR is \\nin the active state, the important catalytic residue D855 \\nis located in the ATP binding site, stabilizing the ATP-\\nloaded complex (DFG-in) and αC helix (αC-in). In the \\ninactive state, EGFR forms a Src-like structure, including \\na closed A-loop, αC-out, and DFG-in [2]. (Fig.\\xa0 1B). EGFR \\ncan dimerize upon binding by ligands, such as amphireg -\\nulin, β-cytokines, epidermal growth factor (EGF), Open Access\\n†Kunyu Shi, Guan Wang and Junping Pei contributed equally to this work\\n*Correspondence:  ouyangliang@scu.edu.cn; yuxiwang@scu.edu.cn; \\nweimi003@scu.edu.cn\\n1 Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Targeted Tracer \\nResearch and Development Laboratory, Institute of Respiratory Health, \\nInnovation Center of Nursing Research, Nursing Key Laboratory of Sichuan \\nProvince, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China\\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlePage 2 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

The activation of the \\nintracellular tyrosine kinase domain and autophospho -\\nrylation, which initiates the Ras/RAF/MEK, signal trans -\\nducer and activator of transcription (STAT), PI3K/AKT/\\nmTOR and other downstream signaling pathways, are \\nclosely related to embryonic development and stem cell \\ndivision [2–4]. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) EGFR \\nprotein with or without EGFR gene amplification or a \\nkinase-activating mutation further enhances cell prolif -\\neration, migration, survival, and antiapoptotic responses \\nthrough signaling cascades, and these processes are \\nclosely related to the occurrence and development of many types of epithelial-derived cancer, such as non-\\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, glioma, \\nhead and neck cancer, cervical cancer, and bladder can -\\ncer. Among these cancers, lung cancer appears to be the \\nmost common and has the characteristics of aberrant \\nproliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance [5–8]. Thus, \\nEGFR has become a promising target for anticancer drug \\ndesign and development. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibi -\\ntors (EGFR-TKIs) have achieved remarkable results in \\nthe clinic [9]. However, most patients develop acquired \\ndrug resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-\\nTKIs after 1–2\\xa0years. The mechanism of drug resistance \\nfor nearly half of cases relates to the T790M mutation. \\nFig. 1 Structure and functions of EGFR.

Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\nThird-generation EGFR-TKIs that target EGFR-TKI-\\nsensitive mutations and the T790M mutation have been \\ndeveloped [10].\\nUnfortunately, drug resistance caused by less-common \\nmutations in the EGFR gene and components of signal \\ntransduction pathways continues to emerge. In addition \\nto common secondary (T790M) and tertiary (C797S) \\nmutations, other EGFR mutations (such as the L718Q, \\nL796S, and L792H mutations and the exon 20 inser -\\ntion), MET amplification, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bis -\\nphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) \\nmutations, HER2 amplification, oncogene fusions, and \\nalterations in cell cycle-related genes have been observed \\n[11] (Fig.\\xa0 1C). There is an urgent need for better strate -\\ngies to combat the inevitable molecular-targeted drug \\nresistance associated with third-generation inhibitors. \\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of \\nthe mechanisms of resistance to third-generation EGFR-\\nTKIs and to explore new insights and strategies for over -\\ncoming acquired resistance.\\nThird‑generation EGFR‑TKIs and\\xa0drug resistance \\nmechanisms\\nThe development of\\xa0third‑generation EGFR‑TKIs\\nThe first-generation EGFR-TKIs form hydrogen bonds \\nwith Met793 in the ATP binding pocket of EGFR and \\nreversibly compete with ATP for binding. Drug resistance \\noccurs due to the EGFR T790M mutation (Thr790 in the \\nhydrophobic ATP binding site encoded on exon 20 is \\nreplaced by methionine), subclonal selection (of a geneti -\\ncally resistant clone), and rare EGFR mutations (such \\nas G719X, S768I, and L861Q). Thereafter, the develop -\\nment of second-generation EGFR-TKIs was reported; \\nthese inhibitors have the same quinazoline scaffold as \\nfirst-generation EGFR-TKIs, but the side chain can irre -\\nversibly bind to Cys797 to inhibit the tyrosine kinase \\nactivity of EGFR. For example, the anilinoquinazoline derivative forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone \\nof Met793 in the hinge region and interacts with the \\nhydrophobic region. The acrylamide group binds cova -\\nlently to Cys797 in the active conformation of EGFR, the \\nfuranyl group is exposed to solvent, and the 3-chloro-\\n4-fluorophenyl group is situated next to the gatekeeper \\nresidue [12–14]. However, mutations such as T790M still \\nemerge upon treatment with second-generation EGFR-\\nTKIs, which have limited selectivity against WT-EGFR, \\nresulting in serious side effects [15]. Fortunately, third-\\ngeneration covalent inhibitors that bind irreversibly to \\nthe target and are mutation-selective have been devel -\\noped. These compounds were designed based on a new \\naminopyrimidine scaffold and show preferable biological \\nactivities [16]. Early clinical trials have proven that these \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs are effective in patients \\nwith double-mutated tumors (EGFR L858R/T790M or \\nex19del/T790M) and have high selectivity for mutant \\nEGFR, thereby eliminating the side effects in the skin \\nand gastrointestinal system associated with the nonselec -\\ntive inhibition of WT-EGFR [17]. For example, the crys -\\ntal structures of rociletinib (CO-1686) in complex with \\nEGFR T790M and EGFR L858R have been published; in \\nEGFR T790M, the anilinopyrimidine group of rociletinib \\nforms hydrogen bonds with the Met793 amide and the \\ncarbonyl backbone, whereas in EGFR L858R, hydropho -\\nbic interactions between rociletinib and the protein were \\ndue to hydrogen bonds between nitrogens in the pyrimi -\\ndine group and between the fluoromethyl and Thr790. \\nIn addition, the acrylamide group in rociletinib cova -\\nlently binds to Cys797 in the DFG-in/αC-in active con -\\nformations [18]. The specificity for EGFR T790M may \\nstem from hydrophobic interactions between the large \\nmethionine in mutant EGFR and pyrimidines. Drugs that \\nhave been approved for marketing include osimertinib \\n(US), almonertinib (China), lazertinib (South Korea), and \\nalflutinib (China) (Fig.\\xa02).\\nFig. 2 Development of third-generation EGFR-TKIsPage 4 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\nMechanisms of\\xa0resistance to\\xa0third‑generation EGFR‑TKIs\\nDue to the covalent bond between the acrylamide \\n(Michael acceptor) of third-generation EGFR-TKIs \\nand the active thiol in the EGFR kinase domain, highly \\nselective inhibitory activity has been achieved by target -\\ning Cys797 and irreversible binding EGFR; thus, these \\ncompounds show excellent antitumor activity. Targeted \\ntherapy for patients with EGFR T790M and EGFR-acti -\\nvating mutations showed good efficacy in both first- and \\nsecond-line settings. In patients who developed resist -\\nance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs as first-line ther -\\napy, genetic changes such as MET amplification, EGFR \\nC797X mutation, PIK3CA amplification and mutation, \\nHER2 amplification and mutation, K-RAS mutation, and \\nBRAF mutation, as well as changes in cell cycle-related \\ngenes and oncogene fusions, have been reported, but no \\nT790M mutations have been detected. The mechanism of resistance to second-line therapy is more compli -\\ncated. Acquisition or deletion of the T790M mutation \\nhas been detected in patients [19], and other EGFR muta -\\ntions (such as L718Q, L796S, L792H, and exon 20 inser -\\ntion) have also been observed (Fig.\\xa0 1B). In addition, the \\nmechanisms of acquired resistance to third-generation \\nEGFR-TKIs include alternative pathway activation and \\nhistologic and phenotypic transformation (Fig.\\xa0 3); the \\ndetails will be discussed in the following sections.\\nPrimary/intrinsic resistance\\nThe differential sensitivity of TKIs to different EGFR \\nmutations is a cause of primary drug resistance. In \\nNSCLC patients, the in-frame deletion of exon 19 \\n(ex19del) and the L858R point mutation in exon 21 \\nare the most common somatic mutations, occur -\\nring in approximately 80% of cases. During EGFR-TKI \\nFig. 3 Molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance. The mechanisms include target gene modification, parallel alternative pathway activation, \\ndownstream pathway activation, and histological/phenotypic transformation. Both amplification and mutation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) \\ncan induce downstream survival signaling pathways. Moreover, direct overexpression and/or mutation of components of downstream pathways \\ncan contribute to acquired resistance by promoting cancer cell survivalPage 5 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\ntreatment, patients with longer median survival have \\npresented with more than 20 unique deletions of exon \\n19. Intrinsic drug resistance can all be triggered by \\nother nonclassical sensitizing mutations (mainly exon \\n20 insertion) and inherent secondary genetic changes. \\nDrug-resistant clones (for example, T790M) may \\nalready exist within the cancer cell population, leading \\nto drug resistance during treatment [20]. Some studies \\nhave found that in nearly 1% of lung cancer patients, \\n2–3 simultaneous driver mutations can be detected \\nbefore treatment. Some molecular and genetic changes \\nhave been reported to relate to intrinsic drug resist -\\nance, such as the lack of K-RAS/phosphatase and tensin \\nhomolog (PTEN) expression. These preexisting molec -\\nular and genetic alterations can stimulate the Ras/Raf/\\nMEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT downstream pathways to \\npromote cancer progression [21].\\nBIM deletion polymorphism\\nBIM is a proapoptotic member of the B-cell lym -\\nphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family [22]. Recent studies showed \\nthat lung cancer cells with the BIM deletion polymor -\\nphism and EGFR mutation are resistant to third-gen -\\neration EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that the BIM deletion \\npolymorphism has potential as a biomarker to predict \\nthe efficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKIs in patients \\n[22].\\nEGFR exon 20 insertion\\nThe molecular mechanism of drug resistance caused by \\nthe exon 20 insertion is not fully understood. Eck et\\xa0 al. \\n[23] hypothesized that this mutation prevents binding to \\nEGFR-TKIs due to the addition of residues to the N-lobe \\nof EGFR. The crystal structure of EGFR exon 20 with the \\nD770_N771insNPG insertion shows an unchanged ATP \\nbinding pocket and a rigid active conformation, leading \\nto steric hindrance of the drug binding pocket and resist -\\nance to EGFR-TKIs.\\nAcquired resistance\\nAcquired drug resistance refers to the process by which \\ntumor cells with prior sensitivity to treatment circum -\\nvent the inhibitory effects of drugs by changing their \\nmetabolic pathways. The mechanisms of acquired resist -\\nance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs can be divided into \\nEGFR-dependent resistance and EGFR-independent \\nresistance [24].EGFR‑dependent drug resistance mechanisms\\nReappearance of\\xa0an\\xa0EGFR mutation\\nC797S mutation\\nOne point mutation of EGFR (C797S) involves the \\nreplacement of Cys797 within the ATP binding site \\n(exon 20) with serine [25]. Osimertinib binds covalently \\nand irreversibly to EGFR T790M by interacting with \\nCys797. When the C797S mutation occurs, the osi -\\nmertinib binding efficiency decreases [10], resulting in \\ntumor resistance to all third-generation EGFR-TKIs.\\nG796R/D mutation\\nThe G796R mutation has been detected in cancer \\npatients who received treatment with a third-gen -\\neration EGFR-TKI. Molecular docking predictions \\nrevealed that G796R sterically hinders the covalent \\nbinding of osimertinib. Because the bulky side chain \\nand hydrophilic group hinder the binding of osimerti -\\nnib to the hydrophobic region, the change in binding \\nenergy renders binding unfavorable. Compared with \\nsamples containing the double-mutant EGFR L858R/\\nT790M, those harboring the triple-mutant EGFR \\nL858R/T790M/G796R are 110 times more resistant \\nto osimertinib [26]. G796D was reported for the first \\ntime in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC patients. In\\xa0vitro \\nstudies have shown that the G796D mutation causes \\na 50-fold increase in the growth inhibitory 50%  (GI50) \\nvalue of osimertinib. Structural modeling showed that \\nthe side chain of the mutated G796D residue collides \\nwith the surface of osimertinib, resulting in steric hin -\\ndrance and energy repulsion and ultimately the loss of \\nbinding affinity [27].\\nL792 mutation\\nThe mutations at Leu792 include L792F, L792Y, and \\nL792H. Structural prediction revealed that these muta -\\ntions introduce a benzene ring or imidazole ring to the \\nside chain of the residue at 792, which spatially dis -\\nrupts the orientation of osimertinib, thereby potentially \\naffecting the binding of osimertinib to the EGFR ATP \\nbinding site [28].\\nM766Q mutation\\nThe homology simulation with the T790M and M766Q \\ndouble mutant showed that M766Q seems to position \\nT790M in the inhibitor binding site, thereby weakening \\nosimertinib binding [29].\\nMutations in\\xa0exon 18\\nEGFR L718Q/V EGFR L718Q was reported for the first \\ntime in a cell model of resistance to third-generation \\nEGFR-TKIs. Subsequent studies have shown that NSCLC Page 6 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\nwith EGFR L858R/T790M/L718Q is resistant to all EGFR-\\nTKIs, but that with only L858R/L718Q remains sensitive \\nto afatinib [30]. The crystallographic model revealed that \\nthe L718Q mutation reduces the efficiency of the forma -\\ntion of covalent bonds between the acrylamide warhead \\nand the Cys797 thiol group, thus interfering with the irre -\\nversible binding of osimertinib [31, 32]. In addition, L718V \\nresistance mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR have \\nbeen detected, and these may interfere with the binding \\nof osimertinib to the kinase domain [33]. Of note, EGFR \\nL718Q/V is still sensitive to afatinib [32].\\nEGFR G724S The G724S mutation in the ATP binding \\nloop enriches this loop in glycine, which can lead to the \\ndevelopment of resistance to EGFR-TKIs by changing the \\nprotein structure, enhancing ATP affinity, and stabilizing \\nactivating mutations [34]. However, this mutation does \\nnot lead to resistance to second-generation EGFR inhibi -\\ntors [34].\\nCompound mutations\\nA compound mutation refers to the simultaneous detec -\\ntion of two or more different types of EGFR mutations in \\npatient cancer cells [35]. The impact of compound muta -\\ntions on EGFR-TKI sensitivity is listed in descending \\norder: double classic mutations, compound mutations \\ninvolving classic mutations and rare mutations, and com -\\npound mutations of only rare mutations [36, 37]. These \\nEGFR mutations caused by treatment with third-genera -\\ntion EGFR-TKIs confer resistance to irreversible pyrimi -\\ndine TKIs but not to quinazoline EGFR inhibitors [38].\\nT790M reduction or\\xa0deletion\\nDeletion of T790M may result from third-generation \\nEGFR-TKI treatment or may be one of the reasons \\nfor drug resistance related to tumor heterogeneity. In \\npatients with EGFR T790M, resistance mechanisms are \\noften associated with the C797S mutation or aberrant \\nactivation of compensatory pathways, whereas patients \\nwith the deletion of T790M typically exhibit different \\nresistance mechanisms, most of which are not associated \\nwith EGFR signaling pathways [39].\\nEGFR amplification\\nPiotrowska and colleagues reported EGFR T790M allele \\namplification in rociletinib-resistant clones [40]. Nukaga \\net\\xa0al. found that amplification of the WT allele of EGFR is \\nsufficient to mediate resistance to third-generation TKIs. \\nThe mechanism of drug resistance may be that EGFR \\ngene amplification leads to a relatively low TKI concen -\\ntration that is insufficient to exert inhibitory activity [41].EGFR‑independent resistance mechanisms\\nNot all patients develop resistance to TKIs through \\nEGFR mutation; other pathways of acquiring resistance \\nto third-generation EGFR-TKIs include the activation \\nof alternative or downstream signaling pathways, epi -\\nthelial interstitial resistance, epithelial–mesenchymal \\ntransition (EMT), histologic and phenotypic transfor -\\nmation, oncogene fusion, and cell cycle-related gene \\nabnormalities.\\nBypass signal pathway activation\\nAbnormal activation of\\xa0MET\\nThere are two main drug resistance mechanisms caused \\nby the abnormal activation of MET: the MET exon 14 \\nskipping mutation (METex14) and MET amplification. \\nMETex14 leads to the loss of ubiquitin ligase binding \\nsites, a reduction in receptor ubiquitination, and per -\\nsistent MET activation, resulting in tumor cell survival \\nand acquired resistance [42]. After treatment with \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs, MET gene amplification \\ncan promote drug resistance by activating MAPK/ERK, \\nwhich is independent of EGFR [43].\\nHER2 amplification\\nHus et\\xa0al. found that H1975 cells expressing HER2D16 \\nwere resistant to osimertinib in\\xa0 vitro. HER2D16 can \\nform a heterodimer with EGFR or a disulfide homodi -\\nmer, which activates downstream signaling to achieve \\nresistance to osimertinib [44]. HER2D16-driven drug \\nresistance occurs in a manner unrelated to the kinase \\nSrc. In addition, other mutations in exon 20 of HER2 \\nhave been reported, including point mutations (such \\nas G776C and L755S) and insertions that cause down -\\nstream activation [45, 46]. HER2 mutation occurs in \\napproximately 2–4% of NSCLC cases, mostly in lung \\nadenocarcinoma (LUAD) [47]. In NSCLC, HER2 onco -\\ngenic amplification occurs in approximately 3% of cases \\nwithout EGFR-TKI treatment and accounts for approx -\\nimately 10% of cases with EGFR-TKI resistance [48].\\nAXL activation\\nAXL is an RTK that regulates cell survival, proliferation, \\nmetastasis, and other cellular functions. Abnormalities \\nin the AXL gene can generate acquired resistance to \\nTKIs by activating relevant downstream signaling path -\\nways. Osimertinib was found to trigger AXL activation \\nby closing the negative feedback loop with SPRY4, thus \\ntriggering inherent osimertinib resistance [49].\\nOverexpression of\\xa0HGF\\nHepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the ligand of the \\nproto-oncogene c-Met; it can trigger MET activation Page 7 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\nthrough EGFR bypass signaling and induce lung can -\\ncer resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Yano et\\xa0al. [50] found that \\nhigh expression of HGF was related to the acquired \\nand intrinsic drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients \\nwith lung cancer. Tumor specimens from patients \\nwith acquired drug resistance showed high expression \\nof HGF in the context of MET amplification and the \\nT790M mutation.\\nFibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling\\nFGFR is a transmembrane RTK. Studies have shown that \\nFGFR1 is amplified and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) \\nmRNA levels are increased in patients with osimertinib \\nresistance, suggesting that the FGFR2-FGFR1 autocrine \\nloop may be related to drug resistance [51]. Patients with \\nthe T790M mutation have been reported to show disease \\nprogression after treatment with osimertinib and nilo -\\ntinib. The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion was detected in ctDNA \\n[52, 53]. These findings suggest that abnormalities in the \\nFGFR signaling pathway may underlie the mechanism of \\nacquired resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs.\\nInsulin‑like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R)\\nIGF1R, a transmembrane heterotetrameric protein \\nencoded by the gene located on chromosome 15q26.3, is \\ninvolved in promoting the growth of tumor cells. Abnor -\\nmal activation of IGF1R leads to EGFR-TKI resistance \\n[54].\\nAurora kinases (AURKs)\\nAURKs are an important category of enzymes within the \\nserine/threonine kinase family consisting of three mam -\\nmalian isoforms: Aurora kinase A (AURK A), AURK B, \\nand AURK C [55, 56]. AURK A and AURK B are highly \\nexpressed in dividing cells and play important roles in \\nmitotic progression. Mammalian AURK A and AURK B \\nshare approximately 71% similarity in the carboxy-termi -\\nnal catalytic domain [57]. Aberrant expression of AURK \\nA and AURK B is involved in a broad range of solid can -\\ncers and is associated with adverse prognosis and drug \\nresistance [58, 59]. In addition, Tanaka et\\xa0al. [60] reported \\nthat targeting AURK B can prevent and overcome resist -\\nance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer by enhancing \\nBIM- and PUMA-mediated apoptosis.\\nDownstream signaling pathway activation\\nThe activation of signaling pathways downstream of \\noncogenic receptors can regulate cell proliferation, cell \\ncycle progression, and cell survival. Therefore, the direct \\nregulation of downstream signaling pathway-related fac -\\ntors can lead to acquired resistance.K‑RAS mutation\\nAn epidemiological meta-analysis found that K-RAS \\nmutations are present in NSCLC patients, and all \\npatients with K-RAS mutations were resistant to EGFR-\\nTKIs [61]. K-RAS mutation is related to activation of \\nthe RAS-MAPK pathway. The common K-RAS muta -\\ntions include G12S, G12D, G12A, Q61H, and A146T. \\nStudies have found that inhibiting mutant K-RAS can \\nreduce tumor growth and render NSCLC patients sen -\\nsitive to EGFR inhibitors [62].\\nBRAF (v‑RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1) \\nmutation\\nBRAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays \\na key role in the MAPK/ERK pathway, including in \\nEGFR/RAS/RAF signal transduction. BRAF can regu -\\nlate cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and \\napoptosis, as well as tumor induction. Many BRAF \\nmutations (G469A, V600E, and V599E) have been \\nfound in cancer, including lung cancer [63]. Ohashi \\net\\xa0 al. [64] reported that in patients with lung cancer, \\nBRAF mutations can induce acquired resistance to \\nEGFR-TKIs. Preclinical data showed that the BRAF \\nV600E mutation has a strong association with resist -\\nance to the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib in \\npatients with T790M-mutated LUAD.\\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR\\nPIK3CA is a driver gene of LUAD. Mutation of PIK3CA \\ncan promote tumor cell invasion and increase the activ -\\nity of downstream PI3Ks. Studies have shown that \\nPIK3CA amplification or mutation (including E453K, \\nE545K, and H1047R) may occur in patients with osi -\\nmertinib resistance [52, 65]. Increased PI3K activity \\nleads to the activation of various downstream kinases, \\nthereby increasing PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activ -\\nity in the absence of coupling to upstream EGFR \\nphosphorylation.\\nSTAT3 activation\\nSTAT proteins, especially STAT3, are key down -\\nstream signal sensors of EGFR activation. In studies \\non NSCLC, Zhao et\\xa0al. [66] discovered the clinical sig -\\nnificance of JAK2/STAT3 in angiogenesis. Chaib et\\xa0 al. \\n[67] found that osimertinib treatment activates not \\nonly STAT3 but also SrcYAP1 signaling, which may act \\ndownstream of IL-6 to promote disease progression.\\nLoss of\\xa0PTEN\\nPTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a pro -\\ntein with lipid phosphatase activity and thus regulates \\ncellular protein phosphatase activity. PTEN has dual Page 8 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\nantitumor effects and is a key component of many sign -\\naling pathways in the body. If mutation or deletion of \\nthe PTEN gene or downregulation of PTEN expres -\\nsion can reduce or eliminate its antitumor activity [68], \\nloss of PTEN leads to hyperactivation of the PI3K/\\nAKT signaling pathway and resistance to EGFR-TKIs, \\nincluding osimertinib.\\nHyperactivation of\\xa0activated Cdc42‑associated kinase 1 \\n(ACK1)\\nHyperphosphorylation of ACK1 and the subsequent acti -\\nvation of antiapoptotic signaling through the AKT path -\\nway are associated with resistance to third-generation \\nEGFR-TKIs [69].\\nc‑Myc gene\\nThe c-Myc gene is an important member of the MYC \\ngene family. The c-Myc gene can induce cells to prolif -\\nerate indefinitely and can promote cell division; these \\nactivities are related to the occurrence and develop -\\nment of various types of cancer. Studies have shown that \\nc-Myc levels are substantially elevated in different EGFR-\\nmutant NSCLC cell lines with acquired resistance to the \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib compared with \\nthe corresponding parental cell lines; moreover, these \\nincreased levels cannot be reduced by osimertinib. Con -\\nsistently, c-Myc levels are elevated in the majority of \\nEGFR-mutant NSCLC tissues from patients who relapsed \\non EGFR-TKI treatment compared with the correspond -\\ning baseline c-Myc levels prior to treatment [70]. These \\nfindings indicate that c-Myc mediates the therapeutic \\nefficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKIs and the develop -\\nment of acquired resistance to these TKIs.\\nOther mechanisms\\nEpithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)\\nIn EMT, cancer cells lose their epithelial properties \\nthrough the loss of E-cadherin, leading to increased \\nvimentin expression and transformation into a mesen -\\nchymal phenotype. A previous study found that osimerti -\\nnib-resistant H1975 cells have EMT characteristics in the \\nabsence of other EGFR mutations [71]. EMT is a coor -\\ndinated process involving multiple regulatory factors, \\nsuch as EMT-induced transcription factors (EMT-TFs), \\nnoncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and various extracellular \\nsignals. EMT-TFs play an important role in all stages of \\nEMT; the most well-known EMT-TFs are members of \\nthe SNAIL, ZEB, and TWIST families. Many studies have \\nshown that SLUG and SNAIL overexpression can induce \\ndrug resistance [72].miRNAs and\\xa0EMT\\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs \\n(miRNAs) play important roles in regulating EMT and \\nTKI resistance. Although most miRNAs have been \\nfound to inhibit EMT, some have activity that pro -\\nmotes EMT, including miR-21 and miR-155 [73, 74]. \\nSome miRNAs can promote TKI resistance by activat -\\ning the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway; for exam -\\nple, miR-21 and miR-23a can target PTEN and activate \\nAKT, leading to resistance to EGFR-TKIs [75, 76].\\nEpigenetic alterations\\nEpigenetic modifications involved in cancer initiation \\nand progression include changes in DNA methylation \\npatterns and histone modifications. Epigenetic changes \\nare common in the development and progression of \\nlung cancer [77]. Studies have shown that epigenetic \\ndisorders can make cancer patients susceptible to \\nacquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs [78].\\nOncogene fusion\\nThe AURA-3 and FLAURA trials showed that onco -\\ngene fusion might be one mechanism of osimertinib \\nresistance; the identified fusions included transform -\\ning growth factor receptor (TGFR)-transforming acidic \\ncoiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), neurotrophic receptor \\ntyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1)-thrombopoietin mimetic \\npeptide 3 (TMP3), ERC1-RET, SPTBN1-ALK, coiled-\\ncoil domain-containing protein 6 (CCDC6)-RET, \\nGOPC-ROS1, AGK-BRAF, NCOA4-RET, ESYT2-BRAF, \\nand echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 \\n(EML4)-ALK. Oncogene fusions can coexist with the \\nEGFR C797S mutation, MET amplification, and BRAF \\nmutation [79].\\nCell cycle‑related gene abnormalities\\nRecent studies have shown that changes in cell cycle-\\nrelated genes, including the CDKN2A E27fs muta -\\ntion, cyclin D (CCND) amplification, cyclin-dependent \\nkinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) amplification, and cyclin E1 \\n(CCNE1) amplification, can cause resistance to third-\\ngeneration EGFR-TKIs [65].\\nHistologic and\\xa0phenotypic transformation\\nHistopathological transformation to small cell lung \\ncancer (SCLC) from NSCLC has been reported as a \\nmechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in \\n3–15% of patients [80– 83]. Transformed SCLC mainly \\noccurs in Asian patients with adenocarcinoma harbor -\\ning EGFR-TKI-sensitive mutations (such as the EGFR \\nex19del/T790M mutation) who are nonsmokers. The \\nwidely accepted hypothesis for this transformation Page 9 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\nposits that adenocarcinoma and SCLC originate from \\ntype II alveolar cells. RB1 and TP53 mutations might be \\ninvolved in SCLC transformation but are not sufficient \\nfor the induction of complete transformation. Addi -\\ntional genomic alterations, including those that acti -\\nvate the PI3K/AKT family and downregulate NOTCH \\nsignaling and those affecting the MYC and SOX fami -\\nlies, AKT pathway activation and other molecules, also \\nparticipate in the transformation from EGFR-mutant \\nNSCLC. However, the precise mechanisms in other \\ncases are unclear [84]. In addition, squamous cell trans -\\nformation was recently identified as a mechanism of \\nacquired EGFR-TKI resistance that occurs in approxi -\\nmately 15% of patients who received osimertinib as \\nboth first- and second-line therapy. Similar to the case \\nin SCLC transformation, the primary EGFR mutation is \\npreserved in squamous cell transformation [85].\\nImmune escape\\nEGFR is expressed in different hematopoietic cell types, \\nincluding macrophages, monocytes, and certain T-cell \\nsubsets. Therefore, it is likely that EGFR inhibitors can \\ninterfere with the function of these leukocytes. Immune \\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have adverse effects and \\npoor efficacy in patients with an EGFR mutation or a sec -\\nondary T790M mutation, largely because of low tumor \\nmutational burden and a noninflamed tumor micro -\\nenvironment [86–88]. A previous study showed that \\nsecreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) promotes macrophage \\nM2 polarization and PD-L1 expression in LUAD, which \\nmay influence the response to immunotherapy. SPP1 lev -\\nels might be a useful marker of immunosuppression in \\npatients with an EGFR mutation and could provide thera -\\npeutic insight [89]. In addition, HGF, MET amplification, \\nand EGFR T790M lead to the upregulation of PD-L1 \\nexpression in NSCLC and promote immune escape by \\ntumor cells through different mechanisms mediated by \\nthe PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB pathways [90].\\nStrategies for\\xa0overcoming third‑generation EGFR‑TKI \\nresistance\\nFourth‑generation EGFR‑TKIs: overcoming the\\xa0L858R/T790M \\nand\\xa0C797S resistance mutations\\nThird-generation EGFR-TKIs had the potential for \\nremarkable achievements, if not for the numerous \\nmutations. The C797S mutation, which is a covalent \\nanchor mutation, is located in the ATP binding site of \\nthe EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. This missense muta -\\ntion in exon 20 at position Cys797 blocks the ability of \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs to form a covalent bond \\nin the ATP binding region, with a consequent decrease \\nin the binding affinity between EGFR and an EGFR-\\nTKI [91]. The combination of the C797S mutation with exon 19 deletion, L858R mutation, or T790M muta -\\ntion was reported both in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo [91]. Studies \\nhave shown that drug-resistant lung cancer cells with \\ntwo mutations (EGFR-activating mutation/C797S) are \\nsensitive to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. \\nHowever, lung cancer cells with three mutations (EGFR-\\nactivating mutation/T790M/C797S) show resistant to \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs if the C797S and T790M \\nmutations are both in the trans conformation. None -\\ntheless, these cells are still sensitive to the combination \\nof first- and third-generation EGFR-TKIs [92]. Of note, \\nif C797S and T790M are mutated in the cis conforma -\\ntion, the cells show resistance to all existing EGFR-TKIs \\n(either alone or in combination) [93]. The resistance to \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs caused by the trans-C797S \\nmutation can be overcome by drugs targeting different \\nkinase binding sites, including allosteric inhibitors, ATP-\\ncompetitive inhibitors, and “dual-site” inhibitors that \\noccupy both the ATP binding site and an allosteric site.\\nAllosteric inhibitors\\nEGFR has three binding sites: an inactive site, a competi -\\ntive ATP binding site, and an allosteric site. Ligands and \\ndrugs cannot bind the inactive site. Recent studies have \\nmostly focused on either ATP-competitive inhibitors tar -\\ngeting the ATP binding site or molecules that bind the \\nallosteric site, which causes a conformational change in \\nthe protein that inhibits the signaling cascade [94]. To \\novercome the resistance of EGFR-TKIs mediated by the \\nT790M and C797S mutations and to further identify and \\nexplore compounds that bind outside the ATP binding \\ndomain of EGFR, researchers have pursued the devel -\\nopment of allosteric inhibitors, and this appears to be a \\npromising strategy. The newly developed fourth-gen -\\neration mutant-selective allosteric inhibitors can over -\\ncome the T790M and C797S mutations that develop in \\nresponse to third-generation EGFR-TKIs by binding to \\nsites outside the ATP binding pocket of EGFR.\\nFig. 4 Screening hit 1a (1) from a phenotypic screen of NSCLC \\ncell lines. A Structure of 1a (1). B X-ray crystal structure of 1a (1) in \\ncomplex with c-Src-DM (PDB code: 5D12)Page 10 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\nThrough molecular phenotypic screening, Engel et\\xa0 al. \\nobtained quinazoline compound 1a (1), which specifi -\\ncally inhibits the drug-resistant H1975 cell line (L858R/\\nT790M); further modification addressed the problem of \\noff-target activity (nonspecific inhibition). X-ray crystal -\\nlography verified that compound 1a (1) fits well in the \\ntyrosine kinase domain of c-Src [95] (Fig.\\xa04).\\nJia et\\xa0 al. conducted counter-screening of active com -\\npounds against WT-EGFR and discovered the first non-\\nATP-competitive allosteric EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S \\ninhibitor based on the thiazolamide scaffold (EAI001, \\n2) [96]. The X-ray crystal structure of EAI001 (2) in \\ncomplex with EGFR T790M shows that EAI001 (2) can \\nbind to the allosteric site of this receptor in the form of \\na “three-bladed propeller, ” partly due to the outward \\ndisplacement of the C-helix in the inactive conforma -\\ntion of the kinase. The hydrophilic side chain of the WT \\ngatekeeper residue (Thr) cannot adapt to the thiazole of \\nEAI001; therefore, there is no favorable interaction. The \\nthiazole of EAI001 closely interacts with the hydrophobic \\nside chain of Met790; specifically, aminothiazole group \\nof EAI001 directly binds to Met790. The carbonyl oxy -\\ngen of the isoindoline-1-one moiety is inserted between \\nthe mutant gatekeeper residue (Met) and the active site \\nresidue Lys745, forming another hydrogen bond with \\nthe ε-amine of the Lys745 side chain. The NH group of \\nformamide acts as a hydrogen bond donor for Asp855 \\nin the DFG motif. The cationic phenyl group occupies \\nthe hydrophobic pocket formed by Met766, Leu777, \\nand Phe856. The 1-oxindolinyl group is exposed along \\nthe C-helix and extends to the solvent-accessible area. \\nThe ATP analog adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-\\nPNP) binds the active site cavity in an expected man -\\nner. The half maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC50) of \\nEAI001 (2) for EGFR L858R/T790M is 24\\xa0nmol/L, which \\nis lower than that for WT-EGFR  (IC50 > 50\\xa0μmol/L). The \\n IC50s of EAI001 (2) for EGFR L858R and EGFR T790M \\nis 0.75\\xa0 μmol/L and 1.7\\xa0 μmol/L, respectively. By intro -\\nducing ortho-hydroxyl and meta-fluorine atoms on the \\nbenzene ring of EAI001 (2), the researchers synthesized \\nanother compound, EAI045 (3), that binds more tightly \\nthan EAI001 (2) to EGFR [96]. However, EAI045 has a \\nmajor drawback: it must be used in combination with \\ncetuximab to preserve its efficacy. While EAI045 (3) has \\ngood selectivity for WT-EGFR, cetuximab is expected \\nto have off-target effects in clinical use. Lee et\\xa0 al. [97] \\ndesigned the EGFR allosteric inhibitor TREA-0236 (4) \\nbased on the structure–activity relationships of EAI045 \\n(3). The structure of EAI045 (3) was modified by cycliza -\\ntion, wherein the 2-aminothiazole amide was converted \\nto quinazoline-4-one. To minimize hematological and \\nmethemoglobinemia toxicity and to obtain better safety \\nand pharmacokinetic parameters, To et\\xa0 al. linked the 5-indole substituent to the isoindolinone of EAI001 (2) \\nand obtained a new EGFR allosteric compound, JBJ-02-\\n112-05 (5), with an  IC50 of 15\\xa0nmol/L for EGFR L858R/\\nT790M [98]. Additionally, EAI045 (3) was further opti -\\nmized to generate another EGFR allosteric inhibitor, JBJ-\\n04-125-02 (6), in which the 2-hydroxy-5-fluorophenyl \\nof EAI045 (3) was combined with the phenylpiperazine \\non isoindolinone. This compound showed a significantly \\nincreased ability to inhibit EGFR L858R/T790M, with \\nan  IC50 of 0.26\\xa0 nmol/L.

The X-ray cocrystal analysis of the \\nbinding mode with EGFR T790M/V948R (Fig.\\xa0 7) revealed \\nthat compounds 34 and 36 bind in the same way. Taking \\ncompound 36 as an example, the aminopyridine moiety \\nforms a hydrogen bond with the M793 residue in the \\nhinge region. The inhibitor is anchored at the ATP bind -\\ning site, and the N atom of the imidazole moiety forms \\na hydrogen bond with K745, which is essential for the \\nstrong reversible binding of the imidazole skeleton. The \\nphenylamide bond extending into the allosteric pocket \\nis directed toward the T790M mutation, and the N atom \\non the amide forms hydrogen bonds with the T854 and \\nD855 residues. Despite considerable efforts, the X-ray \\ncrystal structure of compound 37 in complex with EGFR \\nwas not obtained. Compound 37 was computationally \\ndocked to the EGFR T790M/V948R kinase domain, and \\nthe result was the same as that for compound 36. The \\nmethoxyphenyl acrylamide formed a covalent bond with \\nC797. Importantly, no covalent binding of compound 37 \\nto the EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S kinase domain was \\nobserved, confirming that this compound is a noncova -\\nlent inhibitor.\\nThe inhibitory activity of the above compounds \\nwas tested, and the results showed that compound 34 \\nexhibited strong inhibitory activity against all mutants, \\nwith  IC50 values of 5–32\\xa0 nmol/L, indicating that the \\nintroduction of 2-fluoro-5-hydroxyphenyl alone did \\nnot increase selectivity. With the introduction of oxy -\\nisoindolin-2-yl, the inhibitory activity of compound 35 \\ndecreased, but a certain inhibitory effect against EGFR \\nL858R was observed. Furthermore, compound 1 inhib -\\nited all three EGFR mutants at the low nanomolar range. \\nCompound 37 showed a moderate degree of mutation \\nselectivity for WT-EGFR, possibly due to the methoxy -\\nphenyl acrylamide group. To assess the kinase selectiv -\\nity of compound 37, a kinome screen including 335 WT \\nkinases was performed; compound 37 exhibited high \\nselectivity, with a selectivity score of 0.006 at an inhibi -\\ntor concentration of 1\\xa0 μmol/L. Next, the antiprolifera -\\ntive activity of these compounds was evaluated in Ba/F3 \\ncells stably transfected with WT-EGFR, EGFR L858R, \\nEGFR L858R/T790M, or EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S. \\nAmong the compounds, compound 37 showed an anti -\\nproliferative effect in the EGFR L858R and EGFR L858R/\\nT790M cell lines, with  IC50 values in the micromolar \\nrange in the presence and absence of cetuximab. The \\n IC50 value of compound 37 in EGFR L858R Ba/F3 cells (1.2 ± 0.07\\xa0μmol/L) was comparable to that of EAI045 (3) \\ncombined with cetuximab (840 ± 700\\xa0nmol/L). Although \\ncompound 37 is potent and selective for kinases, its cellu -\\nlar activity is suboptimal. Kinase selectivity was achieved \\nby increasing the molecular weight of the lead compound \\nand increasing the number of hydrogen bond donors and \\nacceptors, but these changes may have produced limited \\ncell permeability and effects on cell viability; thus, this \\ncompound lacked sufficient activity in cells expressing \\nEGFR L858R/T790M/C797S.\\nThe selective EGFR inhibitor (compound 37) designed \\nand developed in this study can bind to both the ATP site \\nand the allosteric site of the EGFR kinase domain. Adding \\nallosteric inhibitor elements to the compound skeleton at \\nthe ATP binding site contributes to the mutation selec -\\ntivity of these compounds. The designed compound 37 \\nhas good kinase activity but nonideal cell activity. Future \\nresearch and development could optimize the structure \\nof this lead compound to further enhance its cellular \\nactivity.\\nPROTAC technology\\nAllosteric EGFR degrader\\nResistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs is a major \\nobstacle to clinical targeted therapy. Due to changes \\nin the EGFR protein [123], some kinase inhibitors are \\nrestricted to the catalytic pocket [124]. A proteolysis-\\ntargeting chimera (PROTAC) induces the proteasomal \\ndegradation of the target by recruiting it to a specific E3 \\nligase. The eradication of EGFR protein from cancer cells \\nprovides a promising strategy for overcoming drug resist -\\nance. The allosteric EGFR degrader is a heterobifunc -\\ntional compound based on allosteric EGFR inhibitors. \\nIt includes a small molecule (protein-of-interest (POI) \\nligand) that binds the target protein and a small-molecule \\nE3 ligase ligand that recruits cereblon (CRBN), von Hip -\\npel–Lindau (VHL), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein \\n1 (cIAP1) or murine double minute 2 (MDM2). After the \\naddition of a linker connecting the two parts [125, 126], \\nthese chimeras can degrade mutant EGFR without affect -\\ning WT-EGFR.\\nCompared with classic “occupying” inhibitors, allos -\\nteric EGFR degraders can completely eliminate the \\nfunction of the target protein, thereby improving the \\nphenotypic potency. Moreover, since PROTAC mole -\\ncules usually do not require strong binding to targets or \\nlong-term retention to achieve protein degradation, the \\ndevelopment of drug-induced resistance mutations may \\nbe prevented. Compared with kinase inhibitors, PRO -\\nTACs have the advantages of activity at lower concentra -\\ntions, limited dose-dependent toxicity, and the potential \\nto overcome drug resistance and target drug refractory Page 20 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

[135] demonstrated \\nfor the first time that in addition to the well-known ubiq -\\nuitin/proteasome pathway, the ubiquitin/autophagy/lyso -\\nsomal pathway participates in PROTAC-induced EGFR \\ndegradation. Based on the EGFR inhibitor canertinib \\n(41) and the CRBN ligand pomalidomide (an E3 ubiqui -\\ntin ligase ligand), researchers generated two novel EGFR \\nFig. 9 Chemical structures and EGFR inhibitory activities of EGFR-targeted PROTACs: the rational design of JBJ-07-200 (41)Page 22 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

These two EGFR degraders showed effective and \\nselective antitumor activity in EGFR-TKI-resistant lung \\ncancer cells.Dual PROTACs\\nThe basic goal of modern drug discovery is to develop \\nefficient and selective drugs for specific targets.

Tumor cells readily gain drug resistance by \\nupregulating an alternative factor or transforming the \\nsignaling pathway that promotes proliferation; therefore, \\ntreatment focused on only a single target has limitations. \\nIn addition to its issues related to drug resistance, single-\\ntarget drugs also show reduced efficacy and can decrease \\nthe quality of life of patients due to side effects and tissue \\ntoxicity.\\nTo overcome the deficiencies of single-target drugs, \\nsingle hybrid molecules fused to two or more pharma -\\ncophores have been designed to simultaneously tar -\\nget two or more antitumor epitopes or targets. These \\nhybrid molecules can simultaneously modulate multi -\\nple targets or pathways and thus generally have better efficacy with fewer side effects. Based on this informa -\\ntion and inspired by the great success of dual-targeted \\ndrugs, especially dual-specific antibodies, Professor \\nLi et\\xa0al. combined the concepts of PROTACs and dual \\ntargeting; this group used trifunctional natural amino \\nacids as starlike core linkers to connect two inde -\\npendent inhibitors, gefitinib (44) and olaparib (45), \\nthat are linked to CRBN or VHL E3 ligands. The syn -\\nthesized novel dual PROTACs can successfully and \\nsimultaneously degrade EGFR and poly(ADP-ribose) \\npolymerase (PARP) in cancer cells [136]. Among the \\ndeveloped compounds, compound DP-V-4 (46) exhib -\\nited the best ability to degrade EGFR and PARP in a \\ndose- and time-dependent manner in H1299 cells and \\nFig. 11 Chemical structure and antiproliferative activity of the dual PROTAC DP-V-4 (46) (through the ubiquitin–proteasome system)Page 24 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

As \\nthe first successful example of a dual PROTAC, this \\nresearch will inject new vitality into the field of com -\\nbination therapy for cancer. Moreover, these findings \\nwill broaden the potential applications of the PROTAC \\nmethod, open new fields of drug discovery, and over -\\ncome the limitations of single-target therapy against \\nEGFR.\\nAnother new technology is the autophagy-targeting \\nchimera (AUTAC), a small molecule that targets protein \\ndegradation through autophagy and contains both a deg -\\nradation tag (guanine derivative) and a warhead to pro -\\nvide target specificity; AUTACs have a wider substrate \\npanel than the ubiquitin–proteasome system [137–139]. \\nTherefore, there is considerable potential for the design \\nand development of AUTAC molecules to degrade EGFR.\\nMonoclonal antibodies and\\xa0ADCs\\nFor patients with EGFR-mutant disease, there are tar -\\ngeted therapies for tumors harboring EGFR-TKI-sensi -\\ntizing mutations [140]. The EGFR monoclonal antibody \\ncan bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR to compete \\nwith EGF binding, thereby blocking downstream signal -\\ning. The variable fragment (Fv) is composed of parts of \\nthe light chain and heavy chain of the antibody and has \\nunique antigen recognition function. The constant region \\n(Fc) mediates innate immunity related to monoclonal \\nantibodies, mainly by binding immune factors or cells to exert antitumor effects. These properties make antibod -\\nies a favorable approach in targeted therapy, especially in \\ncombination with other strategies. In addition, the inter -\\nnalization and degradation of EGFR monoclonal anti -\\nbody and receptor complexes can downregulate EGFR on \\nthe surface of cancer cells. EGFR monoclonal antibodies \\nare now standard-of-care therapies for head and neck \\ncancer and colorectal cancer. Common EGFR monoclo -\\nnal antibodies include cetuximab, necitumumab, panitu -\\nmumab, matuzumab, and nimotuzumab. Antibody–drug \\nconjugates (ADCs) are composed of three moieties: the \\nantibody, linker, and drug (especially those with poten -\\ntial cytotoxicity) (Fig.\\xa0 12). Antibodies are equivalent to \\nprecise arrows, and highly active cytotoxic drugs (the \\npayload) correspond to the gunpowder on the arrows; \\nthese drugs mainly include tubulin inhibitors (monome -\\nthyl auristatin E, monomethyl auristatin F, mertansine, \\nand ravtansine) and DNA-damaging agents (those that \\ncause DNA double-strand breaks, DNA alkylation, DNA \\nintercalation, and DNA cross-linking). It is difficult to \\neffectively kill tumor cells with only cytotoxic drugs, but \\nmonoclonal antibodies alone are too inefficient. ADCs \\ncomposed of both the cytotoxic drug and a monoclonal \\nantibody represent a more powerful combination. ADCs \\ncan precisely target tumor cells by combining highly spe -\\ncific monoclonal antibodies with highly toxic cytotoxic \\ndrugs, thereby achieving a precise attack on EGFR-TKI-\\nresistant cancer cells and filling the gap between antibody \\nFig. 12 The mechanism of ADCsPage 25 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

Being precise and efficient, ADCs \\nhave therapeutic potential across cancer types and can \\nalso induce tumor cell death via the bystander effect \\n[141].\\nHe et\\xa0 al. developed a new ADC targeting EGFR, \\nnamely SHR-A1307 (47) (Fig.\\xa0 13), for the treatment of \\nsolid tumors resistant or refractory to EGFR-targeted \\ntherapy [142]. SHR-A1307 (47) has intermediate abil -\\nity to block EGFR affinity for hR3 and selectively binds \\nto cancer cells expressing EGFR while avoiding inhibi -\\ntory effects on normal cells. In addition to increasing stability and reducing systemic toxicity, Fc domain \\nengineering improved the pharmacokinetics. Although \\nless frequent drug administration may reduce toxin \\naccumulation, effective tumor cell killing with mini -\\nmal toxicity were observed. In addition, SHR-A1307 \\n(47) can effectively kill cancer cells that do not respond \\nto current EGFR inhibitors and shows low nanomolar \\nin\\xa0vitro cytotoxicity in a broad spectrum of cancer cells \\nwith different drug resistance mutations, thus provid -\\ning an attractive treatment opportunity to overcome \\nthe drug resistance of patients with EGFR-overexpress -\\ning tumors.\\nFig. 13 Chemical structure of ADCs targeting EGFR: SHR-A1307 (47) and MRG003 (48) (*Specific research data not disclosed)Page 26 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

In the clinic, \\nHER2 mutation, high HGF expression, and abnormal \\nactivation of MET, AXL, IGF1R and the FGFR pathway were found in patients with acquired resistance to third-\\ngeneration EGFR-TKIs. Mutation or abnormal expres -\\nsion of EGFR signaling pathway-related genes involved in \\nthe Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/MARK, PI3K/PDK1/Akt, PLC-γ \\nand JAK/STAT pathways was also found. Importantly, \\nthese aberrations can coexist in the same tumor and with \\nEGFR-TKI tertiary mutations, which are the basis for \\nthe complexity and heterogeneity of cancer evolution in \\nresponse to EGFR-TKI treatment.

In addition to activating mutations at the EGFR locus \\nthat lead to drug resistance, a large number of genetic \\nand epigenetic abnormalities may also lead to resistance \\nto third-generation EGFR-TKIs. The emergence of intrin -\\nsic and acquired resistance requires appropriate strate -\\ngies to prevent serious side effects. Combination therapy \\nhas additive or even synergistic effects, but due to vari -\\nous dose-limiting toxicities and drug–drug interactions \\ncaused by changes in pharmacokinetics, the simultane -\\nous use of two or more drugs in the clinic is challeng -\\ning. Therefore, as an alternative to combination therapy, \\ndrugs targeting two or more objects have a lower risk of \\ndrug–drug interactions and better pharmacokinetic and \\nsafety profiles, which helps mitigate poor patient compli -\\nance, off-target effects, and high development costs. Such \\ntreatment regimens are more flexible and can represent \\nan effective strategy for cancer therapy [166, 167]. The \\neffectiveness of multitarget kinase inhibitors of WT and/\\nor mutant EGFR has been extensively studied (Table\\xa0 5) \\n[59, 168–197]. Some EGFR-mutant cell lines are sensi -\\ntive to multitarget inhibition and maintain certain levels \\nof activity, highlighting the selectivity of multitarget com -\\npounds and suggesting that multitarget inhibition can be used to circumvent acquired multidrug resistance to \\nEGFR-targeted therapy without serious side effects.\\nNatural products\\nThe discovery of natural products offers new scaffolds for \\ndrug development. Natural products are an important \\nsource of compounds to overcome resistance to third-\\ngeneration TKIs and provide ample possibilities for new \\ndrug discovery. Honokiol (HNK) (98) is a natural prod -\\nuct purified from Magnolia  used as a human nutritional \\nsupplement, with good tolerance and safety profiles. \\nMany preclinical studies have shown that HNK (98) has \\npotential antitumor activity against different types of \\ncancer. Zang et\\xa0al. proved that the decrease in Mcl-1 and \\nthe increase in BIM are the key mechanisms by which \\nosimertinib induces the apoptosis of NSCLC cells with \\nEGFR-TKI-sensitive mutations.

The bind -\\ning affinity of the Fbxo3 protein for endogenous Fbxl2 is \\ngreatly reduced when these five amino acids are mutated \\nindividually or in combination. Data suggest the potential \\nof nebivolol (102) as a small molecule that can disrupt \\nthe Fbxo3–Fbxl2 interaction. Increasing Fbxl2 levels with \\nnebivolol (102) (Fig.\\xa0 14) in combination with osimertinib \\nor a Grp94 inhibitor (ganetespib) to target the FBXL2-\\nGrp94-EGFR axis and thus destabilize EGFR is a possible \\ntherapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to third-gen -\\neration EGFR-TKIs [201].\\nAKR1B1 inhibitors\\nZhang et\\xa0al. discovered that aldehyde ketone reductase \\nfamily 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) interacts with STAT3 \\nand activates the cystine transporter solute carrier \\nfamily 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), which in turn leads \\nto enhanced cystine uptake, glutathione synthesis flux, \\nclearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protection \\nagainst cell death, and EGFR-TKI resistance. The use of \\nselective inhibitors (including the clinically approved \\nanti-diabetic drug epalrestat) to inhibit AKR1B1 can \\nrestore the sensitivity of drug-resistant cell lines to \\nEGFR-TKIs and delay drug resistance in mice har -\\nboring xenografted tumors derived from lung cancer \\npatients [202].\\nPGAM1 inhibitors\\nPhosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is an important \\nenzyme in the glycolysis pathway and is related to tumor \\ncell metastasis [203]. HKB99 (103) (Fig.\\xa0 14) is an allos -\\nteric inhibitor of PGAM1 that significantly inhibits the \\ngrowth and metastasis of NSCLC by affecting the meta -\\nbolic activity and nonmetabolic functions of PGAM1 \\n[204]. The docking model of the PGAM1-HKB99 com -\\nplex shows that HKB99 (103) binds to the allosteric site \\nof the adjacent substrate-binding pocket of PGAM1, thereby inhibiting the conversion of 3-PG to 2-PG and \\nsignificantly reducing the metabolic activity of PGAM1. \\nIn addition, HKB99 (103) can allosterically bind to \\nPGAM1, weaken the interaction between PGAM1 \\nand ACTA2, and inhibit the growth and metastasis of \\nerlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells [205, 206]. There -\\nfore, PGAM1 is a metabolic enzyme that may overcome \\nEGFR-TKI resistance.\\nNonoverlapping allosteric pockets—the X‑Pocket\\nQiu et\\xa0al. revealed the underlying mechanism of reverse \\nallosteric communication in dual-targeted therapy. Allos -\\nteric sites can be affected by orthomorphic drugs. The \\nnonoverlapping allosteric pocket X-Pocket was discov -\\nered in EGFR mutants; this pocket is mainly composed \\nof nonconserved residues, including the hot spots K867, \\nS895, and K960, that can cooperate with traditional TKIs \\n[207]. It is a promising target for the design of selective \\nconformationally restricted drugs, with great potential in \\nterms of affinity, efficacy, and selectivity.\\nDZ‑SIM inhibitors\\nIn addition, researchers found that a group of near-infra -\\nred heptamethine carbocyanine (DZ) fluorescent dyes, \\nthe prototype of which is heptamethylamine carbocya -\\nnine dye (IR-783) (104) (Fig.\\xa0 14), have tumor-targeting \\nactivity through differentially expressed organic anion \\ntransport peptides on cancer cells [208]. This group of \\norganic dyes can specifically deliver therapeutic pay -\\nloads to tumor cells in the form of chemical conjugates. \\nDZ-SIM was preliminarily synthesized; SIM specifi -\\ncally targets 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase \\n(HMGCR) in the endoplasmic reticulum. After specific \\nuptake by tumor cells, DZ-SIM was enriched in subcel -\\nlular organelles (including mitochondria and lysosomes). \\nNSCLC cells were killed by mitochondrial damage, which \\nmainly led to cytochrome C release into the cytoplasm, \\nthereby activating the caspase-3-dependent apoptosis \\ncascade. DZ-SIM inhibited the formation of cancer cell \\ncolonies resistant to first-generation (H1650 and H1975) \\nand third-generation EGFR-TKIs (PC9AR), and most \\n IC50 values were lower than 10\\xa0 μmol/L. DZ-SIM repre -\\nsents a promising new therapy to overcome drug resist -\\nance in patients with EGFR-mutant disease.\\nSelection of\\xa0individualized combination therapy\\nFor patients who experience SCLC transformation, \\nchemotherapy after the development of osimertinib \\nresistance is an option. Research has shown that patients \\nwith transformation to SCLC have higher response rates \\nto etoposide, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. For patients with Page 37 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\n \\nunclear resistance mechanisms, chemotherapy is still \\na treatment option. If the patient is asymptomatic or \\nhas symptomatic local progression, osimertinib can be \\ncombined with local treatment according to National \\nComprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. \\nCarboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and atezolizumab \\n(anti-PD-L1 antibody) are also options for patients \\nwho experience systemic progression after osimertinib \\ntreatment [209]. Whether chemotherapy can delay the \\ndevelopment of resistance to third-generation EGFR-\\nTKIs remains unknown. A study on osimertinib with or \\nwithout chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients \\nwith EGFR-mutant NSCLC is currently recruiting \\n(NCT04035486) [210].\\nFor most patients, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is not the \\nsole rate-limiting factor for antitumor immunity, and \\nblocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is insufficient to activate \\nan effective antitumor immune response [211]. Strate -\\ngies that lead to acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, such as \\nHGF, MET amplification, and EGFR T790M, also pro -\\nmote immune escape in lung cancer by upregulating \\nthe expression of PD-L1. Many combination strategies, \\nincluding α-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy, radio -\\ntherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, targeted therapy, other \\nICIs, agonists of the costimulatory molecule, stimula -\\ntor of interferon gene agonists, epigenetic modulators, \\nor metabolic modulators, have been confirmed to have \\nsuperior antitumor efficacy and a higher response rate. \\nThe immunomodulatory effect of chemotherapy sug -\\ngests that it might be a suitable partner for combina -\\ntion with α-PD-1/PD-L1 to achieve rapid and long-term \\ncancer control. During the KEYNOTE series of clini -\\ncal trials (such as KEYNOTE-021, KEYNOTE-189, and \\nKEYNOTE-407), pembrolizumab combined with stand -\\nard chemotherapy led to better overall survival (OS) and \\nprogression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients and \\nhas been approved by the FDA as first-line treatment for \\nadvanced nonsquamous NSCLC [212, 213]. In addition, \\nthe National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) \\napproved sintilimab plus gemcitabine and platinum as \\nfirst-line treatment for advanced squamous NSCLC \\nbased on the results of ORIENT-12 [214]. In addition \\nto α-PD-1-based approaches, α-PD-L1-based chemoim -\\nmunotherapy has also attracted intense attention. The \\nIMpower150 trial was the pioneer of this series of stud -\\nies, and the FDA-approved atezolizumab plus bevaci -\\nzumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as first-line treatment \\nfor advanced nonsquamous NSCLC [215]. Subsequently, \\nthe FDA-approved atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and \\ncarboplatin for nonsquamous NSCLC (based on the \\nresults of IMpower130). Radiotherapy can also induce \\nimmunogenic cell death and enhance the antitumor \\nimmune response. The results of a phase 1 study showed that α-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemoradiotherapy was toler -\\nable in advanced NSCLC (NCT02621398), with promis -\\ning clinical outcomes. In multiple clinical studies, such \\nas IMpower150, angiogenesis inhibitors enhanced the \\nefficacy of α-PD-1/PD-L1 [216]. Moreover, dual immune \\ncheckpoint blockade or costimulatory molecule agonists \\nplus α-PD-1/PD-L1 are also promising strategies. To date, \\nthe FDA has approved ipilimumab plus nivolumab for \\nNSCLC and melanoma, among others. Agonists target -\\ning costimulatory pathways such as CD27/CD70, CD40/\\nCD40L, and 4-1BB/4-1BBL could also enhance T-cell \\nactivity and restore the antitumor immune response. \\nHowever, bispecific/bifunctional antibodies simulta -\\nneously block two molecules and thus have a strategic \\nadvantage over combination therapy. For example, in the \\nphase 1 NCT03710265 trial, SHR-1701 (TGF-β × PD-L1 \\nbifunctional antibody) showed encouraging antitumor \\nactivity [217].\\nGiven the heterogeneity of mutations across patients, \\nthe selection of individualized combination treatment \\nstrategies could improve outcomes and mitigate treat -\\nment resistance.\\nDiscussion and\\xa0future perspectives\\nEGFR is an important target on tumor cells that pro -\\nmotes mitosis and transformation. It is overexpressed in \\nmany diseases and is particularly related to the occur -\\nrence and development of cancer [3, 7, 8]. Tumors often \\nhave prominent genomic and transcriptional hetero -\\ngeneity that is closely related to EGFR-TKI resistance \\n[40, 218]. Studies have shown that drug resistance can \\ndevelop through EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independ -\\nent mechanisms [24, 219]. The emergence of resistance to \\nthird-generation EGFR-TKIs limits the clinical benefits \\nfor patients, thus necessitating the further development \\nof more effective strategies.\\nTo date, fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs show promi -\\nnent antitumor activity. Recent research has shown that \\nfourth-generation inhibitors targeting allosteric sites \\nand ATP-competitive sites of EGFR can achieve remark -\\nable results against EGFR L858R/T790M and C797S. In \\naddition to fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs, combination \\ntreatments, monoclonal antibodies, and bispecific anti -\\nbodies are significantly contributing to the treatment of \\ntumors harboring the C797S mutation. While the C797S \\nmutation is only one of the numerous drug resistance \\nmechanisms, it is necessary to overcome other muta -\\ntions by designing and developing new noncovalent \\nATP-competitive inhibitors that form hydrogen bonds \\nwith mutated residues in the EGFR ATP pocket (such \\nas Lys745 and Asn842). The rational design of selective \\nEGFR inhibitors that bind to both the ATP and allosteric \\nsites of the EGFR kinase domain, that is, adding allosteric Page 38 of 44 Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology           (2022) 15:94 \\ninhibitor elements to the compound skeleton at the ATP \\nbinding site, will help optimize and improve the mutation \\nselectivity of compounds and lead to the identification \\nof small molecules with good kinase inhibitory activity. \\nHowever, the cellular activity of such compounds needs \\nto be further improved, and future research directions \\nshould focus on the structural optimization of current \\nlead compounds to obtain EGFR inhibitors with better \\nmutation selectivity. Targeted protein degradation tech -\\nnology provides a new research direction for overcoming \\nresistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors. Consid -\\nering the significance of overcoming allosteric hindrance \\nby triple-mutant EGFR, allosteric EGFR degraders were \\ndeveloped. In addition, dual PROTACs have emerged in \\nthe field of cancer combination therapy; dual PROTACs \\ncan be designed with two targets, such as tumor immune \\ntargets plus adjuvant immune targets or energy metabo -\\nlism targets and epigenetic targets plus antiapoptotic tar -\\ngets, to further overcome resistance of third-generation \\nEGFR inhibitors and provide a better curative effect. Of \\ncourse, the larger molecular weight of dual PROTACs \\nwill affect their druggability and pharmacokinetics, \\nbut perhaps nanodrug delivery systems can be utilized \\nto improve drug absorption or optimized by simplify -\\ning the inhibitor moiety and maintaining the minimum \\npharmacophore. In addition, ADCs containing a small-\\nmolecule cytotoxic compound and a monoclonal anti -\\nbody targeting a cancer target have attracted attention. \\nThe ADC MRG003 has entered clinical trials with great \\ndevelopment and application prospects. The activation of \\nalternative pathways and histological transformation are \\nimportant mechanisms of resistance to third-generation \\nEGFR inhibitors. The combined use of third-generation \\ninhibitors and related pathway blockers is another impor -\\ntant approach. To prevent the toxicity and side effects of \\nmultidrug combinations, drugs with multiple pharmaco -\\nlogical activities were developed and proven to have more \\nadvantages than combination therapy. Multitarget kinase \\ndrugs have become a favorable choice due to their attrac -\\ntive pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety profiles. \\nNatural compounds have received much research atten -\\ntion due to their potential antitumor effects. Based on the \\nmolecular mechanism of inhibition, natural compounds \\ncan be modified to provide new insights for effectively \\novercoming resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs. \\nLast but not least, the discovery of EGFR degraders based \\non the FBXL2-Grp94-EGFR axis, AKR1B1 and PGAM1 \\ninhibitors, DZ-SIM, and the nonoverlapping allosteric \\npocket X-Pocket provides promising support for the fur -\\nther development of strategies to overcome resistance \\nto third-generation EGFR inhibitors. The mechanism of \\nresistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs is very com -\\nplex, is impacted by EGFR mutations, and differs among patients and tumor sites. Thus, next-generation sequenc -\\ning (NGS) of blood-based circulating tumor DNA \\n(ctDNA) or tissue samples to elucidate the resistance \\nmechanism will be valuable for guiding future therapeu -\\ntic approaches and for clinical research on novel combi -\\nnation therapies to overcome drug resistance. Moreover, \\nindividualized combination treatment strategies could \\nalso improve treatment efficacy and mitigate treatment \\nresistance.\\nEGFR is a verified target for antitumor therapy in a \\nbroad spectrum of cancers. Facilitated by versatile strate -\\ngies in the field of medicinal chemistry, better approaches \\nare anticipated for overcoming the hurdle of drug resist -\\nance to provide new hope for patients.\\nConclusion\\nAs a crucial “controller” that is related to the inhibi -\\ntion of tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, \\nmetastasis, and apoptosis, EGFR actively participates in \\nmalignant disease progression. However, the intrinsic \\nand acquired resistance in primary and recurrent can -\\ncer which is mediated by EGFR mutations after target \\ntreatment leads to difficult therapeutic. Understanding \\nthe complex resistance mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs and \\ndeveloping potential strategies to combat it could be of \\npotential interest for improving the individual therapeu -\\ntic strategies for cancer.\\nAbbreviations\\nACK1: Activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1; ADC: Antibody drug conjugates; \\nAKR1B1: Aldehyde–ketone reductase family 1 member B1; A-loop: Activation \\nloop; ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; AURK: Aurora kinases; AUTAC : Autophagy-\\ntargeting chimera; Bcl-2: B cell lymphoma-2; BRAF: V-RAF murine sarcoma \\nviral oncogene homolog B1; CCND: Cyclin D; CCNE1: Cyclin E1; CDK4/6: \\nCyclin-dependent kinase 4/6; cIAP1: Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1; \\nCRBN: Cereblon; DFG: Asp-Phe-Gly; DZ-SIM: DZ-SIMvastatin; EGF: Epidermal \\ngrowth factor; EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor; EGFR-TKIs: Epidermal \\ngrowth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors; EMT: Epithelial–mesen-\\nchymal transformation; EMT-TFs: EMT-induced transcription factors; ERC1: \\nExcision repair cross-complementation 1; FGF: Fibroblast growth factor; FGFR: \\nFibroblast growth factor receptor; Fv: Variable region fragment; Grp94: Glucose \\nregulatory protein 94; HB-EGF: EGF-like growth factor; HMGCR : 3-Hydroxy-\\n3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HNK: Honokiol; ICIs: Immune checkpoint \\ninhibitors; IGF1R: Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1; LUAD: Lung adenocar -\\ncinoma; MDM2: Mouse double minute 2; NCCN: National Comprehensive Can-\\ncer Network; NSCLC: Non-small cell lung cancer; NTRK1: Neurotrophic tyrosine \\nreceptor kinase 1; PARP: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PGAM1: Phosphoglycer -\\nate mutase 1; PIK3CA: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic \\nsubunit; PROTAC : Proteolysis-targeting chimera; PTEN: Phosphatase and tensin \\nhomolog; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; RTK: Receptor tyrosine kinase; SCLC: \\nSmall cell lung cancer; SLC7A11: Solute carrier family 7 member 11; SPP1: \\nSecreted phosphoprotein 1; STAT  : Signal sensor and transcription activator; \\nTACC3: Transforming acid helix protein 3; TGF: Transforming growth factor; \\nTMP3: Thrombopoietin mimetic peptide 3; VHL: Von Hippel–Lindau; WT: Wild-\\ntype; WT-EGFR: Wild-type EGFR.\\nAcknowledgements\\nNot applicable.Page 39 of 44\\n Shi\\xa0et\\xa0al.

       "The EGFR T790M mutation, a substitution of threonine with methionine at position 790 within the EGFR protein's tyrosine kinase domain, creates steric hindrance.  This occurs in the ATP binding site of the EGFR protein, specifically impacting the interaction of the drug with the hydrophobic region near the gatekeeper residue. The amino acid chain directly involved is the single amino acid change from threonine (Thr) to methionine (Met) at position 790.  Overcoming this steric hindrance can be achieved through several approaches, including the development of allosteric inhibitors which bind to a different site on the protein, causing a conformational change that disrupts the binding of the ATP competitive inhibitor, or the use of PROTAC technology to degrade the mutated EGFR protein entirely.\n"
